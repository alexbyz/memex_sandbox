Two<br>more letters have been preserved among the Acts of the Council of Aquileia<br>of 381. The larger of the two corpora transmitted outside the collection prob-<br>ably originated with Paulinus, one of <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s priests,’ and his biographer.<br>‘The smaller corpus appears to be later, dating perhaps from the late ninth or<br>early tenth century.® The first printed edition of the letters was published in<br>1490.

H.W. G. Liebeschuetz<br><br>kept copies of his letters, and so evidently assumed that they would one<br>day be read by a wider public. For he could write to Sabinus, bishop of<br>Placentia: ‘I have sent you these introductory remarks (with the works<br>Lam sending you for criticism), and if you are agreeable, I will insert them<br>in the books of my letters, and preserve them among their number, so that<br>they [sc. the books] will be promoted by the inclusion of your name.<br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> quotes Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians: ‘What we are by<br>letters when absent such we are also in deeds when bodily present’, and com-<br>ments: ‘Paul printed the image of his presence on his letters.’ He clearly<br>hoped to achieve the same effect with his own letters, and, again like Paul,<br>not only while he was living, but for long after. As we will see, the collec-<br>tion has a very individual character, and it is reasonably safe to assume<br>that this reflects the interests of its compiler, and that the compiler was<br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> himself.<br><br>If <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> put together the collection himself it is almost certainly his<br>last work." The collection was certainly in existence when Paulinus wrote<br>his Life of <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> in c. 412-13, for he assumed that readers of the biog-<br>raphy would be able to find elsewhere the full text of a letter to which he<br>only alludes, but which is included in the collection (Zp. v.30). The col-<br>lection must therefore have been in existence by that time. Book vi of the<br>collection is introduced by a letter commenting on the decision of Paulinus<br>of Nola and of his wife to give away their property and live an ascetic life.<br>This was in 395." Book x includes the oration on the death of Theodosius I,<br>who died in January 395. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> died in 397. So the collection was prob-<br>ably compiled and given to the public between 395 and 397.<br><br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s duties as bishop and public figure must always have obliged<br>him to write a very large number of ‘business letters’ to a wide range of<br>individuals. But when he was old the letter also became his preferred<br>literary medium, as he writes to his colleague Chromatius, bishop of<br>Aquileia: ‘I prefer to chat with you in the words of an old man, to show<br>that I can still do it, rather than to go on in loftier style about some-<br>thing that befits neither my interest nor my strength. Similarly he tells<br>Sabinus, bishop of Placentia: ‘I have now chosen that which old men find<br><br> <br><br>easier, to write letters in ordinary and familiar language, weaving in any<br>passages from the scriptures that happen to come to mind.’ So it was<br><br>Ep. 32 (48), 7-2 Cor. ro: 10-11, in Ep. 37 (M47), 7-<br><br>Ep. 32.

We know that <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> preserved copies also of some letters<br>that he had not included in the collection, because Paulinus cites passages<br>from two such letters in his biography.'* He had evidently found those let-<br>ters in an archive at Milan. Subsequently Paulinus offered those two letters<br>together with eight others to a wider readership in the smaller corpus of ten<br>letters which has been mentioned earlier.” In addition we have a few refer-<br>ences to some letters, the texts of which have not come down to us."<br><br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> sometimes deprecates his own literary efforts, but he was in<br>fact a very careful writer. When Sabinus offered to read his writings critic-<br>ally, <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> gladly accepted the offer, and sent Sabinus a volume:?<br><br>1 have thought it right to take up your invitation; it is now up to you to<br>discern clearly and examine carefully what requires correction ... Everyone<br>is beguiled by what he himself writes and its faults escape his ear ...<br>A writer is flattered by his own discourses however inelegant. The meaning<br>is often expressed carelessly, or so as to arouse antagonism in the reader, or<br>ambiguously.<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>Sabinus is to read the work and to correct all such faults. Subsequently<br>Sabinus complained that a volume <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> has sent him is difficulr to<br>read. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> explains that in his old age he is anxious to choose his<br>words with precision, and to compose his literary works with deliberation.<br>This he finds easier if he writes them down himself than if he dictates<br>them to a scribe.”<br><br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> gives as the reason for his fastidiousness that he wants to make<br>sure that he is disseminating ‘sound faith and a sober confession’. A reli-<br>gious opponent must not find any words which could be construed to<br>support heretical beliefs. But almost certainly there was also another rea-<br>son. In late antiquity letters were recognised as a distinct literary genre,<br>one which offered highly educated men a medium in which they could<br>exercise and display their education, taste and learning, irrespective of<br>their everyday occupation and way of life. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> had enjoyed a very<br><br>‘6 Paulinus, Vita Ambr<br><br>«Ep. ex. 1 (M41), 253 Ep. ex. 10 (M57), 27.<br>Ixxxv—vi.<br>and Zel: "Ep. 32 (M48), 2.<br>» Ep. 37 (M47), 2: nobis curae est senilem sermonem familari usu ad unguem distinguere, et lento quo-<br>dam figere gradu.<br><br>» Ep. 32 (M48), 3: fidei sinceritas et confessionis sobrietas.<br><br>  <br> <br> <br><br>    <br><br>Downloaded from httpsi/Awww.cambridge.org/core.

H.W. G. Liebeschuetz<br><br>full education in both Latin and Greek rhetoric, at a time when good<br>knowledge of Greek was becoming rare in the West. He certainly used his<br>letters to display his considerable literary skill, good Latin style and learn-<br>ing, particularly of course his knowledge of the text of the Bible, but also<br>of Cicero, Virgil’ and Pliny, at least when writing to a correspondent who<br>would recognise and appreciate allusions to Latin classics.<br><br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s collection was divided into ten books. We know this because<br>in the manuscript the words explicit liber and incipit liber seem to have<br>signalled the end of each book and the start of the next.5 The books are of<br>very different lengths, Book x being by far the longest. It is significant that<br>there are just ten books, that is the same number of books as in the clas-<br>sical collection of the younger Pliny. Moreover <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s tenth book, like<br>Pliny’s Book x, is concerned with high politics, and its author's relations<br>with the secular state and successive emperors. (This book will be discussed<br>in the final section of this chapter.) The similarities cannot be accidental.<br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s collection is clearly, at least in this respect, modelled on that<br>of Pliny, as is the collection of the letters of <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s contemporary, the<br>famous pagan senator and orator Aurelius Symmachus, who too preserved<br>copies of his letters for eventual publication. When he died in 402, it was<br>left to his son, Memmius Symmachus, to edit his father’s letters, and like<br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> he arranged them in ten books, of which the last is once more<br>composed of letters to emperors. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> was a committed Christian<br>and Symmachus a conservative pagan, but both had been brought up in<br>the same literary culture. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> certainly wanted his writings to be<br>appreciated not only for their Christian message but also for their literary<br>style. In 384 Aurelius Symmachus had addressed a speech to the emperor<br>Valentinian I] arguing for the restoration of the Altar of Victory to the sen-<br>ate chamber at Rome, and <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> had answered him in a speech refuting<br>Symmachus’ arguments, one by one. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> included both speeches in<br>his collection, and in so doing challenged readers to compare not only the<br>religious arguments of the two men, but also their oratorical skills.<br><br>While <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> surely had Pliny’s collection of letters in mind when<br>he composed his own collection, his letters are very different from those<br>of Pliny. What then are the characteristics of <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s collection? First<br>some negatives. The letters are not in chronological order. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> has<br>made no attempt to arrange the letters in the order in which he had<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>  <br> <br><br>     <br><br>» List of allusions to Virgil: Faller and 1996: 48.<br><br>» Faller and Zelzer 1990: xvii-xviii.

Most of the letters relating to the council of Aquileia<br>have been transmitted outside the collection.2” The collection inchides a<br>few letters that show <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> acting as the leader and spokesman of the<br>north Italian bishops, but he must have written far more of such letters<br>than he has inchided to construct and maintain his authority. The col-<br>lection presents nothing like a complete record of <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s life. What<br>it gives us is rather selected representative glimpses of the wide range 0<br>activities that filled <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s time. People ask <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> for advice, most<br>often about the meaning of passages of the Bible, but also about prac-<br>tical matters. Letters show <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> as a pastor and conciliator,” giving<br>instructions to his own clergy, and taking an interest in the election 0<br>bishops at Vercelli” and at Thessalonica.” The letters show him exercising<br>jurisdiction at Verona,® but also, and consistently in Book x, that he had<br>been ready to intervene whenever he thought that the rights of the church<br>were being infringed, no matter by whom, even confronting the emperor<br>when necessary. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s letters have impressed posterity, as <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b><br>no doubt hoped that they would, but the letters of, for instance, Basil and<br>Augustine give a much fuller account of the varied business that occu-<br>pied a bishop in late antiquity.

H.W. G. Liebeschuetz<br><br>Like Pliny, <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> used his collection of letters to introduce the<br>reader to numerous acquaintances, to senators, bishops, clerics and lay-<br>men, and last but by no means least, emperors. But unlike Pliny, he was<br>not concerned to construct an impressionist panorama of the society in<br>which he lived. The letters contain very few personal details, and as a<br>result many individuals figuring in his correspondence are difficult to<br>identify with persons mentioned in other sources. The shortage of per-<br>sonal and circumstantial information also makes the dating of most of<br>the letters very uncertain, and often impossible.%* It is, however, clear<br>that <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s choice of letters for preservation was not motivated by<br>snobbery. He was not concerned to publicise the extent of his intim-<br>ate relations with magnates of the empire. Of his letters to emperors<br>no fewer than eleven have only survived outside his collection. We can<br>be certain that his position would have obliged him to write far more<br>letters to senators and high officials than he has admitted into his col-<br>lection. Moreover, the letters addressed to individuals whom scholars<br>have identified as secular magnates are usually short and formal. The<br>addressees whose names recur in the collection are simple clerics and<br>laymen. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> was out to show that he has not been a respecter of<br>persons.<br><br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>, unlike for instance Synesius, tells his correspondents little,<br>or indeed most often nothing, about his own circumstances. He did not<br>write letters in order to talk about what he was doing, or to explore his<br>own feelings. This does not mean that he had no feelings. He enjoyed<br>letter-writing as a form of companionship. So he writes to Sabinus: ‘I am<br>never less alone than when I seem to be so. For then I summon at pleas-<br>ure whom I will, and associate to myself those whom I love most or find<br>most congenial, and no man interrupts or intrudes upon us.?” But what<br>he enjoyed in correspondence with friends was the discussion of prob-<br>lems posed by the Bible, not exchanges of information about each other's<br>business.<br><br>Here are some of the problems discussed in letters: in the frst letter of<br>the collection, <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> interprets a sentence from Exodus which com-<br>mands that in a time of plague each Israelite should give halfa drachma as<br>a ransom for his life to the Lord.** How can a benevolent God say: ‘J put<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>* Many of the dates of the edition of the Maurist Fathers are unreliable: Palanque 1931: 480-556, as<br>are those still cited in Beyenka 1967.<br><br>» E.g. in Book VIN, Epp. 58 (M60), 59 (M84), 60 (Myo), 61 (M89).<br><br>6 Cloero, De off yaa.

Augustine's account o.<br>his conversion illustrates why allegory was employed so widely in biblical<br>commentaries, sermons and dogmatic controversy in late antiquity an<br>subsequently. The young Augustine was strongly drawn to Christianity,<br>not least through the influence of Monica, his mother, but he was long<br>held back from full commitment by the fact the Bible included many pas-<br>sages that seemed far from edifying. When he came to Milan and hear<br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> interpreting such awkward passages allegorically, the difficulty<br>disappeared. “The Catholic faith ... I now concluded with myself, might<br>well be maintained without absurdity ... after I had heard one or two<br>places of the Old Testament resolved ... which when I understood lit-<br>was slain.” The fact that Christianity is a religion of the Book<br>was an advantage it had over the traditional cults which originated in<br>pre-literate times. But fundamentalist interpretation raised difficulties -<br>as it still does — which allegorical interpretation of the awkward passages<br>could, and can, by-pass.<br>e difficulties which troubled <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> and his correspondents are<br>generally not as fundamental as those that kept Augustine from becoming<br>a fully committed Christian. The Arian controversy, in which <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b><br>took so prominent and aggressive a part on the Nicene side, does not fig-<br>ure at all prominently in these discussions. Many of the questions seem to<br>be motivated by interest in the problem raised, rather than doubts threat-<br>ening the questioner’s faith, though some are about important questions<br>of doctrine or conduct. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> generally replies in a relaxed style which<br>is quite different from the intense aggressiveness of his dogmatic writings.<br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> learnt his allegorical technique from Philo, and, as we have seen,<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>omy<br><br>erally,<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>8 Ep. 1 (M7), 1-2: ut epistulares fabulas et sermonem absentium ad interpretationem conferamus oraculi<br>caelestis,<br><br>* Augustine, Conf v4, us.

The affair of the Altar of Victory has often been seen as the<br>decisive engagement in a conflict of religions, signifying the final victory<br>of Christianity over the traditional religion of Rome. It is, however, hardly<br>noticed by other writers of the period. It owes its fame to its presentation<br>in the collection of <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>.<br><br>There follows a letter which <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> purports to have written ia win-<br>ter 388/9 to the emperor Theodosius I warning him neither to punish the<br>participants in the burning of a synagogue in the frontier fortress city of<br>Callinicum, nor to compel the local bishop to rebuild it. The letter, as we<br>read it in the collection, implies that the bishop was at the time still under<br>orders to have the synagogue rebuilt. In fact careful reading of the letter<br>shows that the emperor has already rescinded the order.8” Much of what<br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> tells the emperor in this letter, the emperor evidently knows<br>already, and has even acted upon. It looks as if <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> has redacted the<br>original letter to turn it into a full statement of <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s case, not only<br>for the emperor but for the record and to guide posterity.”<br><br>The last episode to be documented in the collection is a conflict<br>between <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> and the imperial rulers of the West, Valentinian II and<br>his wife Justina, which was drawn out from around Easter 385 to Easter<br>386. It arose over imperial support for an Arian bishop at Milan, and more<br>specifically over repeated demands that <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> should allow one of his<br>churches to be used for Arian services. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> refused, organised a sit-in<br>in the threatened church, got the besieged congregation to sing hymns,<br>and displayed not only courage, but also great demagogic skill to prevail<br>against the imperial authorities. The last document in the dossier describes<br>the discovery of relics of the martyrs Gervase and Protase which <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b><br>evidently interpreted — or wished his readers to interpret — as a sign that<br>God approved the stand that he had taken.<br><br>Book x is certainly not simply a collection of correspondence. The<br>ossier on the Altar of Victory includes a speech of Symmachus and a<br>‘letter’ that is in fact a speech answering Symmachus’ speech. The letter<br>to Theodosius about the synagogue at Callinicum reads as if it had been<br>heavily edited to make what is in effect a presentation of <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s case<br>addressed to a wider public.

The letters nevertheless tell us a great deal about <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>, the man.<br>They reveal an extraordinarily gifted and versatile personality. <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b><br>was obviously exceptionally strong-willed, and an extremely skilful pol-<br>itician.

His motivation was of course ultimately theological, yet he had<br>a poet’s sensitivity. His must always have been an overwhelming presence,<br>but he could be very sociable, and he sometimes wrote a letter simply<br>because he felt lonely in his high and responsible office. Above all he was a<br>conscientious pastor, ever anxious for the well-being of his flock.

Augustine shares the view that in the spiritual hierarchy, the state of<br>consecrated virginity is superior to that of marriage. In turn, the state of consecrated widowhood is superior to the married state but inferior to the state of consecrated virginity. In<br>terms of the Gospel parable, virginity yields fruit one hundred-fold, widowhood, sixty, and marriage only thirty. In earlier times, the martyr had been at the sammit of this spiritual<br>pyramid. But these were not the times of open persecution.<br><br>   <br><br> <br><br>     <br><br>able copyright tow.<br><br>    <br><br>Luse the word “state" with good reason because Augustine was acutely aware that "states of perfection" as such did not guarantee the sanctity of individuals in them. In the<br>larger field of his views on the Church, while it was better to be a member of the Church than not to be one, this alone was no iron-clad guarantec of ultimate salvation. He never<br>tired of repeating that there were some in the Church now who would not be found in the ultimate City of God in heaven and some not in the Church visibly now who would be<br>saved, (They would presumably have to find their way to the Church before their deaths.)<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>So, too, there were individual consecrated virgins and widows who were inferior spiritually to holy married women, Here one might compare this view with Jerome who in his<br>etter 22 to the young aspiring ascetic Eustochium, proclaimed that she should not mingle with married women since she was superior to them. (Jerome, ep. 22.16)<br><br>stine, on the other hand, was quite aware that a prime danger for consecrated virgins was the temptation to pride. A good part of his treatise On Haly Virginity (FOTC 27) is<br>dedicated to the consideration of this problem. At the beginning of the City of God, when he was searching for answers to the questions posed by bewildered Christians and<br>saucy pagans as to the reasons for Rome's apparent decline in power under Christian emperors, one objection thrown up to him concerned the rape of consecrated virgins by the<br>pillaging Goths.

Apparently, he worked as a notaries for<br><b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> in the latter's final years, <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>'s successor, the neoplatonist philosopher-priest, Simplicianus, invited Paulinus to go to North Africa to supervise the property of the<br>church of Milan, presumably estates and plantations. He went and spent many years there. His letter to Augustine probably was written in Africa. Making his acquaintance,<br>Augustine asked him to write about <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>, The usual date given for this biographical work is c. 422.<br><br>       <br> <br>   <br><br> <br><br>   <br><br>What Paulinus is asking for is not entirely clear but it seems that the question involves a sort of “lives of the saints,” ie, martyrs, by Augustine. This is not as unusual as it may<br>sound, After all, he also wrote a summary book of heresies when asked by Quodvultdeus (De haeresibus 428-429; cf. ep, 221 of c. 426-427). In this case, however, Augustine<br>wisely declined. He had preached many sermons on the martyrs but he felt he could not match the powerful simplicity of the passiones themselves. His own contribution here lay<br><br>       <br><br>   <br><br>primarily with theology and spirituality rather than hagiography and history.

As soon 48 he was promoted to prefect, he reported to the<br>emperor Theodosius that the great city of Antioch in Syria had spread<br>out and increased in size, and had many buildings extending up to 4 mile<br>outside its walls, Then the emperor Theodosius ordered that the houses<br>outside the city should also be surrounded by a wall.

The military force which was with him<br>caused an uproar in the city over billeting, and so the inhabitants of<br>Thessalonike rioted and insulted the emperor; and when he was watching<br>the races in the city with the hippodrome full, he ordered his archers<br>to shoot. at the crowd and as many as 15,000 were killed.

It should suffice to<br>mention here that for <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>, as for Symmachus, Rome was indeed the greatest<br>city of the Empire. But, according to <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>, its claim to greatness was not its<br>pagan past, but its Christian present.” Rome’s importance did not depend on its glo-<br>rious pagan past or its political position, but on the fact that it became a Christian<br>centre that was founded by two apostles.*° This new insight gave Romanitas a signif-<br>icant Christian twist, and although it was not felt immediately, it gradually became<br>standard throughout the West.<br><br>In the fifth century, although stripped of real power, Rome the city, the ancient<br>capital of the Empire, still symbolized auctorifas and stood at the centre of the sen-<br>atorial elite’s self-perception. It was, for example, an integral part of Sidonius Apol-<br>linaris’ Romanitas.* He visited Rome many times; he was the praefectus urbis in 468/<br>9; and he praised its beauty in his poems and letters.” In that respect, Sidonius’<br>sense of Romanitas was very similar to that of Praetextatus’, and the only difference<br>between them is the fact that unlike Praetextatus, who collected religious affiliations<br>and priesthoods, Sidonius Apollinaris ended his life as the bishop of Clermont.”<br>Things, it appears, had changed dramatically, yet religious service, albeit in a Chris-<br>tian context, still remained a crucial component of the elite’s sense of duty and def-<br>inition of Romanitas.<br><br>A century after Sidonius the balance between Rome’s political prestige and its<br>Christian disposition had shifted altogether. Although the ancient glory of the city<br>as the capital of the Empire did not fade away, especially not in the writings of illus-<br>trious representatives of the provincial senatorial elite, the auctoritas of Rome was<br>mostly derived from the papal see. If we examine, for instance, when and where<br>Gregory of Tours mentions Rome in his Books of History, the point becomes even<br>clearer. Rome is first mentioned when Gregory tells how Peter arrived there.*<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>28 Wytzes 1977, 29-47, Alan Cameron 2011, 39-51; C.

Gregory is indifferent<br>to the fact that Rome was once the capital of an empire, and he refers to it inciden-<br>tally as the residence of the senate.’° The conquest of Rome by Alaric and the Goths,<br>to which Augustine devoted much thought and his monumental De civitate Dei, is<br>mentioned by Gregory in passing while discussing the sources for the reign of Clo-<br>vis.” It is obvious that although Gregory calls Rome ipsa urbs urbium et totius<br>mundi caput ingens (‘that city of cities and the mighty head of the whole world’),<br>his attitude towards Rome was utterly Christian, echoing <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>’s response to<br>Symmachus.<br><br>This Christian takeover is also reflected in the terminology used by Gregory. In<br>his book On the Glory of the Martyrs, to give just one example, Gregory writes that<br>the Visigoths Romanos enim vocitant nostrae homines relegionis (‘refer to the men<br>of our religion as Romans’). On the other hand, he uses the adjective barbarus<br>as a synonym for paganus, implying that the relation between barbarus and Roma-<br>nus has changed from a cultural to a religious one.** Romanus for Gregory denoted<br>religious affiliation, and the contrast between barbarus and Romanus therefore par-<br>alleled the contrast between ‘Catholic’ and ‘Arian’ or ‘Christian’ and ‘pagan’. Hence,<br>when Gregory and other members of the Gallo-Roman senatorial elite called them-<br>selves ‘Roman’, they were defining their status — or rather their Romanitas — in Chris-<br>tian terms.<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>However, equating Christianitas with Romanitas in the post-Roman barbarian<br>world was a double-edged sword.

Using ‘homoian’, ‘homoiousian’, or ‘heterousian’ will only complicate the<br>matter, and one should constantly bear in mind that even these terms are not clear-cut and straight-<br>forward, and they are also open to various interpretations.

I propose<br>to do so by setting up a deliberately artificial distinction between the aristocracy an<br>the elites of the city on the one hand, and the popes on the other, excluding the<br>opes themselves from the analysis. This may seem somewhat problematic methodo-<br>ogically since, from the second half of the eighth century, most popes were members<br>of the main aristocratic families in the city, and most top level papal functionaries o<br>the Lateran bureaucracy, especially the seven palatine judges, likewise.” Similarly,<br>ooking at it from the other end, most important aristocratic families were importan<br>artly because they held offices or titles associated with the papal entourage, notably<br>the primicerius and the superista. Examples of primicerii include <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>, primicer-<br>ius between 742/3 and his death in 752, and his successor Christopher, effectively the<br>Foreign Affairs ministers, who wielded huge power under popes Zacharias, Ste-<br><br>those same Romans were aware of the Franks’ reverence for St Peter and thought<br>they could be deceived in this way.<br><br>While the papacy and pilgrimages are well-known territory, my own interest is in<br>he pendant of this development: how did the Romans perceive the past of their city?<br><br>answer to this lies less in matters of imperial and papal ideology,<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>ian I, and Theodotus, uncle of Hadrian I, former duke of Rome<br>founder and patron of the diaconia of S.

Such was especially Paul Afiarta, who attempted to bring<br>the papacy and the king of the Lombards into a closer alliance under Hadrian P°,<br><br> <br><br>and later on Gra‘<br><br> <br><br>ian, superista involved in an alleged plot under Leo IV and Bene-<br><br>ict HI and accused of being a spy for the Emperor Lothar in Rome.** Nevertheless,<br><br>I will justify making the distinction here between the aristocracy and the popes, in so<br>far as, once popes, many of these men either had to, or chose to, or needed to, think<br><br> <br><br>12 Toubert 1973, 2, 1202~1229 and 2001; Wickham 2015, 187-188.<br><br>13 LP I, Zacharias, ce. 12, 14, 18, pp. 429-432, and Stephen II, c. 5, 24 (<b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>), pp. 441, 447; Ste-<br>phen If, c. 49, p. 455, Stephen III, cc. 5, 7~8, 11, 15, 28~ 32, pp. 469 - 473, 478 - 480, and Hadrian I, cc. 5,<br>14, pp. 487, 490 (Christopher); Hadrian 1, c. 2, p. 486 (Theodotus).<br><br>14 Annales regni Francorum a. 821, trans.

Only two, possibly three,<br>bishops were senators: Cyprian of Carthage (a doubtful case), Petilianus,<br>the Donatist bishop of Cirta, and Fulgentius of Ruspe. This is partly due to<br>the relative paucity of senators in Africa, and partly due to the dense pattern<br>of urbanization, which yielded large numbers of curiales. A further need for<br>clergy in North Africa was occasioned by the existence of a parallel, Donatist<br>hierarchy.

The following<br>remarks therefore aim to bring into focus the most important patterns, but<br>make no claim to completeness. Since the breakdown of the Roman ma-<br>chinery of government at end of the fourth century as a result of immigra-<br>tion and intermittent warfare, men of senatorial background were ap-<br>pointed to the episcopate in ever-increasing numbers. By the fifth century,<br>this trend was well established. Deprived of access to the emperor as a<br>source of dispensation of honors and distinctions, these men found in the<br>episcopal office an opportunity to maintain their prominent role in local<br>society and to continue in activities that were associated with and expected<br>y their status, most particularly public benefactions through building<br>patronage and the provision of public entertainments, and the leisure to<br>engage in literary pursuits. This overlap of aristocratic markers of social emi-<br>nence with Christian good works contributes to the development of the holy<br>ishop of noble background as a type in Latin hagiography.<br><br>Especially in the late fourth and fifth centuries, many bishops of senato-<br>rial background in Gaul attained their appointment, just like their col-<br>leagues in the pars Orientis, after many years in office in the civil adminis-<br>tration. Often, the episcopate was conferred on them directly, without prior<br>experience in ecclesiastical office—confirmation of the ease with which so-<br>cial status could be translated into ecclesiastical rank. An early example of<br>a locally prominent senator-turned-bishop is Claudius Lupicinus, bishop of<br>Vienne. He had been a vir consularis in the 380s, and his civic benefactions<br>were commemorated in several honorific inscriptions.'!° This pattern con-<br>tinued in the fifth century. Sidonius Apollinaris’s father and grandfather<br>had held the praetorian prefecture of the Gauls, and his wife was the daugh-<br>ter of the future emperor Avitus. Sidonius himself was city prefect of Rome<br>in 468. Soon thereafter, back in Gaul, he was ordained bishop of Clermont<br>in 470 and exercised his duties with great dedication and diligence until his<br>death in 487.1"! Germanus became bishop of Auxerre under circumstances<br>not too dissimilar from those that brought <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> to the episcopate.<br>While he was holding a high office, probably the governorship of the<br>province Lugdunensis Quarta, he was ordained to the priesthood and des-<br>ignated as the next successor to the episcopal see of that city, which he<br>would hold for thirty years, from 418 to 448.'

The case<br>of Cyrus, bishop of Cotyaeum, has already been mentioned. In the same<br>manner, the short-lived Western emperor Avitus was deposed in 456 and<br>made bishop of Piacenza,!’ and Glycerius’s deposition after only one year<br>as Western emperor was followed by his appointment to the episcopal see of<br>Salona in 474.1"<br><br>At the same time, however, the tradition of men who passed through the<br>intermediary stage of monasticism before they became bishops continued<br>on into the early fifth century, in Gaul as much as elsewhere. Eucherius of<br>Lyon, the author of the monastic treatise In Praise of the Desert, for example,<br>hailed from a senatorial family. Together with his wife and two daughters, he<br>took up a monastic retreat on the island of Lérins, while entrusting the edu-<br>cation of his two sons to the bishops Honoratus and Hilarius. He later<br>became bishop of Lyon, probably in 434.1%<br><br>Beginning with the last decades of the fifth century, a third pattern of<br>episcopal recruitment from the senatorial aristocracy emerges. Until now,<br>we have encountered the direct transition from secular to ecclesiastical ca-<br>reer exemplified by <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> of Milan and the episcopal appointment pre-<br>ceded by monastic practice, as in the case of Paulinus of Nola and many of<br>the fourth-century curiales. Now for the first time we encounter men of dis-<br>tinguished background whose careers evolved entirely within the context of<br>the church."* Christianity had now permeated all aspects of Gallic society,<br>and the region had politically become detached from Italy. Consequently,<br>family traditions of gaining distinction through civic office or public bene-<br>factions found a new venue in the church as an institution. Men of promi-<br>nent background who were appointed as bishops could thus enjoy a newly<br>defined position of eminence, while at the same time continuing to bestow<br>their patronage on their civitas. Gregory of Tours is a prime example of this<br>pattern. He came from a senatorial family of great wealth. On his father’s<br>side, the family could trace its descent from the senator Vettius Epagathus,<br>one of the martyrs of Lyon in 177. His father’s uncle had been a priest, and<br>his father’s brother was a bishop. His mother’s side of the family had in the<br>last two generations produced one senator and at least five bishops. After<br>obtaining the requisite secular education, Gregory opted for an ecclesiasti-<br>cal career, entering the ranks of the clergy as a deacon. After ten years, in<br>573. he became bishop of Tours and dedicated the last two decades of his<br>life until his death in 594 to ecclesiastical administration and the composi-<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>  <br><br>133.

Already the Council of Nicaea<br>isted that a suitable time must elapse between baptism and ordination to<br>the priesthood or the episcopate. A few decades later, the Council of Sardica<br>declared that wealthy men or men with extensive legal training, scholastici tes<br>agoras, should not become bishops immediately but had to rise through the<br>ecclesiastical ranks.!®4 Still in the sixth century, Justinian found it necessary<br>to endorse the observation of proper procedure in ecclesiastical appoint-<br>ments.'*> Nevertheless, when the need arose, ecclesiastical ritual could serve<br>as a substitute for the proper interstices. Such was the case with <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b>,<br>who received baptism, “all the ecclesiastical offices,” and ordination to the<br>episcopate, all within the course of one week.’ The preference for men<br>with abundant worldly qualifications, but without a firm grounding in the<br>faith or without much experience in ecclesiastical matters, did not go un-<br>criticized. Jerome, for one, noted sarcastically: “Yesterday a catechumen,<br>today a priest. Yesterday at the theatre, today in the church. In the evening<br>at the chariot-races, the next morning at the altar. Recently a fan of actors,<br>now a consecrator of holy virgins.”!"<br><br>ins<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>   <br><br>THE PERMEABILITY OF CIVIC AND ECCLESIASTICAL OFFICE<br><br>For many upwardly mobile curiales, the episcopate was the crowning glory of<br>their public career. One such ambitious curialis was M. Tulius Eugenius, who<br>died ca. 340 after twenty-five years as bishop of Laodiceia Combusta in<br>Phrygia.

Libanius thus redeems the city from the negative<br>image of the Misopogon. But the Presbeutikos does more than that: it also presents a<br>very positive image of both Libanius himself and Julian. Indeed, Libanius appears from<br>the text not only as a close friend and advisor of Julian’s, but also as a free-speaking<br>defender of Antioch.?* The former is shown to have useful results, in that Libanius has<br>Julian say that it was actually the orator who solved the food shortage (15.8). The latter<br>is demonstrated by Libanius’ readiness, towards the end of the text (15.83), to link his<br>fate as a sophist to his success in convincing Julian with the Presbeutikos. Spoken after<br>Julian’s death, these words did not entail any real risk for Libanius, but they did show<br>commitment to his city and confidence in his oratory. Especially at a time when Julian’s<br>religious reforms were being turned back and Julian’s followers were being removed<br>from positions of power, stressing his independence from Julian as well as the usefulness<br>of his oratory may have been a wise step — especially for someone who was widely<br>seen as too much the deceased emperor’s man in Antioch.%” At the same time, however,<br>this presentation was also to Julian’s credit: in one of the tropes of panegyric, it was<br>acceptable for emperors to be carried away by anger as long as they were willing to<br>listen to free-spoken council and come back on decisions taken under the spur of<br>anger.°® Nobody knew, of course, what Julian’s response to the Presbeutikos would<br>have been, but the suggestion in the speech that Julian was willing to listen to Libanius<br>boded well. The Presbeutikos therefore comes as close as was still possible after Julian’s<br>death to removing the single blot on Julian’s career in Libanius’ eyes. In a more subtle<br>and implicit, but not less well-targeted way than the explicitly commemorative Orations<br>17 and 18, Libanius’ performance of the Presbeutikos after Julian’s death thus tries to<br>mould the audience’s interpretation of Julian’s stay in Antioch.<br><br>More than five years after the composition of the Presbeutikos,?? Libanius would go<br>even further in absolving Julian in his Epitaphios (18.195-9). The reason for this was<br>that, while the wound inflicted on Antioch by Julian’s Misopogon had already had some<br>time to heal, in the new political climate under Valens, it might now have been Julian<br>rather than Antioch who risked being seen in a negative light because of the Misopogon.<br>In a speech designed explicitly to shape the memory of Julian’s reign as a whole,<br>Libanius therefore absolves Julian of any wrong-doing by saying that Julian applied the<br>punishment not of a tyrant, but of an orator. According to the Epitaphios, then, the<br>Misopogon shows not so much the emperor’s anger, but his control of it, Like Orations<br>16 and 15, the Epitapbios was originally delivered for a small public!°® and may<br>therefore not have had a great impact initially. In due course, however, the Epitaphios<br>would become a key document for historians of the following decades, offering, as it<br>did, a full account of Julian’s life.!°! Combined with Julian’s very similar presentation of<br>events in the Misopogon, Libanius’ Epitaphios proved irresistible to most of them.<br><br>°° Closeness is emphasized in Or. 15.6-13 and 82-6.

For Krautheimer, Rome refused to<br>become Constantine’s Christian capital, and this was an important reason for<br>the emperor's decision “to abandon the West altogether” and set up a capital at<br>Byzantium.” Nonetheless, Krautheimer saw a pagan-Christian conflict as over<br>by the end of the fourth century, from which point he saw the city as “under<br>papal rule”.”' his description of the bishop of Rome as “de facto ruler of Rome<br>in the fifth century”” is seriously challenged by Mark Humphries.”<br><br>4. CHRISTIAN CAPITALS<br><br>It is now possible to paint a far more nuanced picture of Rome as a “Christian<br>capital,” and several chapters in this book illuminate the picture still further.<br>Again, we know significantly less about Constantinople in the fourth and fifth<br>centuries, but it is clear that the shape of Christianity in these two cities also<br>differed greatly. The cities’ respective statuses as Christian capitals were of<br>course highly unequal, at least at the start of our period. Whatever we think of<br>Eusebius’ claim that in Constantinople, Constantine created a city free from<br>idol worship (VC 3.47), it is clear that the pagan past was far less prominent in<br>the New Rome than in the old. As discussed above, the “Christianization” of<br>the city of Rome has been the subject of a great deal of scholarship and can be<br>looked at from a wide range of perspectives, taking in a host of sources, archae-<br>ological as well as literary. We know very little indeed about the Christian<br>community in Byzantium, but it seems likely it was small and lacking in<br>importance, even on a local scale, with no particular traditions of its own that<br>survived, That is, Constantinople also lacked a significant Christian past.<br><br>For example, Constantinople was lacking in prominent martyrs, though<br>there were two local ones, Mokios and Akakios. In 356-57 Constantius II<br>moved apostolic—and therefore world-class—relics of Timothy, Luke, and<br>Andrew to Constantinople.” This was a clear attempt to give Constantinople<br>more clout as a holy city, and further prestigious relic translations would follow<br>under Theodosius I.” The activities of <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> in providing martyrs for the<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>90.

Lat. 2(12).1.2):<br><br>nam cum te semper ultra omnes retro principes laudari oportuerit, nunc<br>porro ultra quam alias praedicatus es in ea urbe conveniat dicendo cele-<br>brari, cuius et libertatem armatus adservisti et auxisti dignitatem toga-<br>tus, quo tandem modo consequi maiestatem utriusque vestrum oratione<br>mea potero hoc praecipue in tempore, quo ita mutuo ambo crevistis, ut<br>nec tu fueris adhuc maior nec illa felicior?<br><br>For since it was right before to praise you beyond all emperors, from<br>now on let it be proper to celebrate you in speech, more than you have been<br>acclaimed in other places, in that city whose liberty you have defended<br>under arms and whose dignity you have increased wearing a toga; how<br>will I be able to match the majesty of both of you in my speech, particu-<br>larly at this time when both of you [ie Theodosius and Rome] have so<br>grown together that you have never been greater and the city more blessed?<br><br>It is a commonplace of panegyric for the speaker at the outset to confess<br>rhetorical inadequacy, but Pacatus’ words here have very topical urgency, in-<br>vigorating a potentially hackneyed formula. The exaltation of Theodosius ele-<br>vates him beyond his fellow emperor, Valentinian II; and his presence in<br>Rome is presented as the culmination of his and the city’s glory. At the speech’s<br>close, Pacatus reprises the sentiment of the inextricability of emperor and city<br>in sharper, more explicit terms (Pan.Lat. 2(12).475):<br><br> <br><br> <br><br>Romam vidi, Theodosium vidi, et utrumque simul vidi; vidi illum prin-<br>cipis patrem, vidi illum principis vindicem, vidi illum principis restitu-<br>torem!<br><br> <br><br>I have seen Rome, I have seen Theodosius, and I have seen both of<br>them together; 1] have seen that father of an emperor, I have seen that<br>avenger of an emperor, I have seen that restorer of an emperor.<br><br>31.

Little had<br>changed two years later: the orator (perhaps the same man”) notes how Rome,<br>again the gentium domina and now also the sedes imperii (“seat of empire,”<br>12.1~2), had strained to catch a glimpse of the emperors when they met in<br>Milan. In the closing lines, the speaker foresees Maximian’s victory in a forth-<br>coming sea battle with Carausius in terms of the naval trophies that will adorn<br>the rostra at Rome, an imaginative conceit weakened by his location of the ros-<br>tra in the Campus Martius (9.6”)—again it seems, an appeal to Rome as the<br>rightful place of empire was irresistible, even if some of the detail was shaky.<br><br>The diversorum vii document the response of the provincial elite to a<br>changing political landscape over a thirty-year period, starting a century<br>before Pacatus included them in his collection. What precisely Rome meant to<br>Gaul in those three decades of change is impossible to say, other than that the<br>seven speeches in various ways share a vague and sometimes naive dedication<br>to the city as the heartland of their cultural identity and political loyalty, even<br>when occupied by a hostile party. None is as direct or insistent as the capital<br>city panegyrics in the collection, but together they are indicative of Gaul’s en-<br>during commitment, even when facing adversity, to the idea and reality of<br>Rome; but when seen in the context of the framing speeches 4(0) and 12(9)<br>celebrating the battle of the Milvian Bridge, the commitment to the idea and<br>reality of Rome is seen to be conditional—conditional that is, on the right em-<br>peror controlling the city.

His two sons were already full Augusti: Arcadius, who had<br>been left in Constantinople, since 383, and Honorius, who had been with Theo-<br>dosius in Milan, since 393. They now took over territorial responsibility for the<br>east and the west respectively. The age of the emperors (17/18 and 10 at accession<br>to sole rule) seriously weakened the imperial office: neither showed much incli-<br>nation or any ability to assert control over their governments subsequently. De<br>facto Arcadius remained under the control of the eastern praetorian prefect<br>Rufinus, and Honorius now came under that of Stilicho. But Stilicho alleged<br>that Theodosius had commended the guardianship of both sons to his care,<br>which neither Rufinus nor his successors at the eastern court were willing to<br>accept. When Rufinus was lynched in November 395 by troops returning from<br>the west, the strings of the puppet Arcadius came under the control of Eutro-<br>pius, the eunuch chamberlain. Claudian’s poems are an eloquent, but deeply<br>partial, source of information for the period. As early as his panegyric for the<br>third consulship of Honorius in 396 he insists forcefully on Stilicho’s right to<br>act as guardian of the eastern as well as the western emperor, and this remains<br>a constant motif thereafter (3Cos. 151~53).’<br><br>Yet more interesting is the series of epic invectives which he launched at<br>around the same time. First came two books against Rufinus, the first de-<br>scribing his villain’s origins as an emissary of hell, sent to destroy the Roman<br>state, and the second recounting his fall after attempting to thwart Stilicho<br>(and naturally much of the action, including the lynching, is set in Constanti-<br>nople). The next crisis to be recorded was the war against Gildo, magister mili-<br>tum of Africa and a native prince, who in 397 had attempted to change the<br>allegiance of the African diocese from the western to the eastern part of the<br>empire. This was a threat to both western prestige and Rome’s food supply, and<br>Stilicho had him declared a public enemy (of the eastern court’s matching dec-<br>laration of Stilicho as hostis publicus we hear not a word from Claudian). The<br>western court’s grievance against the east is still carefully understated in the<br>first book against Gildo: the deified emperor Theodosius visits the dreaming<br>Arcadius in Constantinople, while his father Count Theodosius simultaneously<br>visits Honorius in Milan, so that any suggestion of serious division between the<br>courts is neutralized.

Meletius, bishop of<br>Antioch, died soon after the council began, and discussions concerning his suc-<br>cessor proved viciously divisive, not least because of Gregory's intervention on<br>behalf of a candidate favored by Rome and the west, but by very few in the east.<br>Timothy, bishop of Alexandria, was only summoned after the council had<br>already begun and apparently also found himself at odds with the majority as<br>soon as he arrived." Gregory describes the “bitter wind from the west” that Tim-<br>othy whipped up, in concert with allies “from Macedonia’; other sources to<br>allow us to reduce this Macedonian contingent to the solitary figure of Acholius<br>of Thessalonica, who is attested as a close ally of Damasus of Rome.’ A collateral<br>victim of this west wind was Gregory himself. He presents himself as a conve-<br>nient target for the newcomers’ animosity against the eastern bishops who had<br>consecrated him, the object of pettifogging challenges to his eligibility for the<br>see, which finally drove him to resign after only about a month in office.<br>Despite the access they enjoyed to the most promising talents of the whole<br>eastern church (Constantinople must have been full of eligible presbyters at-<br>tending their bishops), the council then replaced Gregory with an unbaptized<br>layman, the genial senator Nectarius. As already noted, yet another bishop of<br>Constantinople was dealt with in the council’s fourth and final canon, con-<br>cerning “Maximus the Cynic and the disturbance which had happened over<br>him at Constantinople.” This declared that Maximus, whose attempted coup<br>and ignominious expulsion the previous year Gregory also chronicled, was not<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>now, nor had ever been, a genuine bishop.<br><br>These twists in conciliar politics must obviously be relevant to the formula-<br>tion of the canons. Because our sources keep the council’s legislation separate<br>from its politics, however, we can only guess at the relationship between the<br>two. Socrates and Sozomen themselves faced the same problem, and they<br>solved it by placing the production of the canons at the end of the council, after<br>Nectarius had been happily enthroned (Socrates HE 5,8.12-13; Sozomen HE<br>7.9.1). That this was only a guess is clear from Sozomen’s account of Canon 4,<br>when he evidently supposes the abortive consecration of Maximus to have<br>been attempted during the council, as an attempt by the Egyptian delegation<br>to install a zealous Nicene during the vacancy (presumably) after Gregory’s<br><br> <br><br>14.

Although<br>of Egyptian origin, Maximus was not an Egyptian cleric but a long-term resi-<br>dent of Constantinople, who had made his pitch to Peter while visiting Alexan-<br>dria as a representative of the Nicene community. He is more plausibly seen,<br>then, as a tenacious freelancer. The support that he received from Peter was<br>only provisional: Maximus was left to fight his own battles, and was shrugged<br>off when he lost these.”* Nor is there any reason to believe that Maximus would<br>have reduced Constantinople to an Alexandrian satellite had his coup suc-<br>ceeded, any more than his (temporarily triumphant) rival Gregory subjected it<br>to Cappadocian interests. Modern research has meanwhile steadily chipped<br>away at fourth-century Alexandria’s traditional reputation for doctrinaire in-<br>terventionism: a recent paper has reduced the most notorious example—their<br>support for the Antiochene anti-bishop Paulinus—to a negotiation tactic.”<br>The church of Alexandria was arguably more plotted against than plotting<br>throughout the fourth century, and there is no evidence that it cast any signif-<br>icant shadow over Constantinople before Theophilus marched against Chryso-<br>stom.”* Alexandria was in no position to impose itself upon the 381 council: the<br>list of signatories includes only two Egyptian bishops, Timothy and the bishop<br><br>of Oxyrhynchus, and although a large corps of invisible suffragans is often as-<br>26<br><br> <br><br>sumed in their train, there is no basis whatever for such an assumption.” It is<br><br>therefore for advocates of an anti-Alexandrian tendency to explain what sort of<br>threat the assembled bishops can have seen in Timothy and his lone associate,<br>and how Canon 3 might have responded to this.<br><br>22.

The foundation for a partial rehabilitation of<br>Maximus is sketched by Mossay, “Note sur Héron-Maxime.”<br><br>23. Modern scholarship has too readily translated Gregory's claims that Peter “sent” the<br>bishops who consecrated Maximus (DVS 851), and that they in turn “sent” sailors from the fleet<br>ahead as scouts (DVS 844~45), into a well-organized chain of command (McGuckin, Saint<br>Gregory, 314); but it should be noted that <b style=color:red>Ambrose</style></b> of Milan, in subsequently making the case<br>for Maximus, seems to say only that Peter’s “mandate” extended to performing the cerernony<br>inside a private house (Ep. extra Coll. 9[13|.3, ed. Zelzer, p. 202, where the word order given in<br>the apparatus is to be preferred to that of the text), and also that he carefully separates this<br>mandate from the letters of communion which Peter gave Maximus, presumably during the<br>latter’s visit to Alexandria after his unsuccessful visit to the imperial court at Thessalonica (cf.<br>DYS 1013-23).<br><br>24.
