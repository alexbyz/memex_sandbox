For he could write to Sabinus, bishop of\nPlacentia: ‘I have sent you these introductory remarks (with the works\nLam sending you for criticism), and if you are agreeable, I will insert them\nin the books of my letters, and preserve them among their number, so that\nthey [sc. the books] will be promoted by the inclusion of your name.\nAmbrose quotes Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians: ‘What we are by\nletters when absent such we are also in deeds when bodily present’, and com-\nments: ‘Paul printed the image of his presence on his letters.’ He clearly\nhoped to achieve the same effect with his own letters, and, again like Paul,\nnot only while he was living, but for long after. As we will see, the collec-\ntion has a very individual character, and it is reasonably safe to assume\nthat this reflects the interests of its compiler, and that the compiler was\nAmbrose himself.\n\nIf Ambrose put together the collection himself it is almost certainly his\nlast work.\" The collection was certainly in existence when Paulinus wrote\nhis Life of Ambrose in c. 412-13, for he assumed that readers of the biog-\nraphy would be able to find elsewhere the full text of a letter to which he\nonly alludes, but which is included in the collection (Zp. v.30). The col-\nlection must therefore have been in existence by that time. Book vi of the\ncollection is introduced by a letter commenting on the decision of Paulinus\nof Nola and of his wife to give away their property and live an ascetic life.\nThis was in 395.\" Book x includes the oration on the death of Theodosius I,\nwho died in January 395. Ambrose died in 397. So the collection was prob-\nably compiled and given to the public between 395 and 397.\n\nAmbrose’s duties as bishop and public figure must always have obliged\nhim to write a very large number of ‘business letters’ to a wide range of\nindividuals. But when he was old the letter also became his preferred\nliterary medium, as he writes to his colleague Chromatius, bishop of\nAquileia: ‘I prefer to chat with you in the words of an old man, to show\nthat I can still do it, rather than to go on in loftier style about some-\nthing that befits neither my interest nor my strength. Similarly he tells\nSabinus, bishop of Placentia: ‘I have now chosen that which old men find\n\n \n\neasier, to write letters in ordinary and familiar language, weaving in any\npassages from the scriptures that happen to come to mind.’ So it was\n\nEp. 32 (48), 7-2 Cor. ro: 10-11, in Ep. 37 (M47), 7-\n\nEp. 32.

We know that Ambrose preserved copies also of some letters\nthat he had not included in the collection, because Paulinus cites passages\nfrom two such letters in his biography.'* He had evidently found those let-\nters in an archive at Milan. Subsequently Paulinus offered those two letters\ntogether with eight others to a wider readership in the smaller corpus of ten\nletters which has been mentioned earlier.” In addition we have a few refer-\nences to some letters, the texts of which have not come down to us.\"\n\nAmbrose sometimes deprecates his own literary efforts, but he was in\nfact a very careful writer. When Sabinus offered to read his writings critic-\nally, Ambrose gladly accepted the offer, and sent Sabinus a volume:?\n\n1 have thought it right to take up your invitation; it is now up to you to\ndiscern clearly and examine carefully what requires correction ... Everyone\nis beguiled by what he himself writes and its faults escape his ear ...\nA writer is flattered by his own discourses however inelegant. The meaning\nis often expressed carelessly, or so as to arouse antagonism in the reader, or\nambiguously.\n\n \n\n \n\nSabinus is to read the work and to correct all such faults. Subsequently\nSabinus complained that a volume Ambrose has sent him is difficulr to\nread. Ambrose explains that in his old age he is anxious to choose his\nwords with precision, and to compose his literary works with deliberation.\nThis he finds easier if he writes them down himself than if he dictates\nthem to a scribe.”\n\nAmbrose gives as the reason for his fastidiousness that he wants to make\nsure that he is disseminating ‘sound faith and a sober confession’. A reli-\ngious opponent must not find any words which could be construed to\nsupport heretical beliefs. But almost certainly there was also another rea-\nson.

He certainly used his\nletters to display his considerable literary skill, good Latin style and learn-\ning, particularly of course his knowledge of the text of the Bible, but also\nof Cicero, Virgil’ and Pliny, at least when writing to a correspondent who\nwould recognise and appreciate allusions to Latin classics.\n\nAmbrose’s collection was divided into ten books. We know this because\nin the manuscript the words explicit liber and incipit liber seem to have\nsignalled the end of each book and the start of the next.5 The books are of\nvery different lengths, Book x being by far the longest. It is significant that\nthere are just ten books, that is the same number of books as in the clas-\nsical collection of the younger Pliny. Moreover Ambrose’s tenth book, like\nPliny’s Book x, is concerned with high politics, and its author's relations\nwith the secular state and successive emperors. (This book will be discussed\nin the final section of this chapter.) The similarities cannot be accidental.\nAmbrose’s collection is clearly, at least in this respect, modelled on that\nof Pliny, as is the collection of the letters of Ambrose’s contemporary, the\nfamous pagan senator and orator Aurelius Symmachus, who too preserved\ncopies of his letters for eventual publication. When he died in 402, it was\nleft to his son, Memmius Symmachus, to edit his father’s letters, and like\nAmbrose he arranged them in ten books, of which the last is once more\ncomposed of letters to emperors. Ambrose was a committed Christian\nand Symmachus a conservative pagan, but both had been brought up in\nthe same literary culture. Ambrose certainly wanted his writings to be\nappreciated not only for their Christian message but also for their literary\nstyle. In 384 Aurelius Symmachus had addressed a speech to the emperor\nValentinian I] arguing for the restoration of the Altar of Victory to the sen-\nate chamber at Rome, and Ambrose had answered him in a speech refuting\nSymmachus’ arguments, one by one. Ambrose included both speeches in\nhis collection, and in so doing challenged readers to compare not only the\nreligious arguments of the two men, but also their oratorical skills.\n\nWhile Ambrose surely had Pliny’s collection of letters in mind when\nhe composed his own collection, his letters are very different from those\nof Pliny. What then are the characteristics of Ambrose’s collection? First\nsome negatives. The letters are not in chronological order.

The col-\nlection presents nothing like a complete record of Ambrose’s life. What\nit gives us is rather selected representative glimpses of the wide range 0\nactivities that filled Ambrose’s time.

Liebeschuetz\n\nLike Pliny, Ambrose used his collection of letters to introduce the\nreader to numerous acquaintances, to senators, bishops, clerics and lay-\nmen, and last but by no means least, emperors. But unlike Pliny, he was\nnot concerned to construct an impressionist panorama of the society in\nwhich he lived. The letters contain very few personal details, and as a\nresult many individuals figuring in his correspondence are difficult to\nidentify with persons mentioned in other sources. The shortage of per-\nsonal and circumstantial information also makes the dating of most of\nthe letters very uncertain, and often impossible.%* It is, however, clear\nthat Ambrose’s choice of letters for preservation was not motivated by\nsnobbery. He was not concerned to publicise the extent of his intim-\nate relations with magnates of the empire. Of his letters to emperors\nno fewer than eleven have only survived outside his collection. We can\nbe certain that his position would have obliged him to write far more\nletters to senators and high officials than he has admitted into his col-\nlection. Moreover, the letters addressed to individuals whom scholars\nhave identified as secular magnates are usually short and formal. The\naddressees whose names recur in the collection are simple clerics and\nlaymen. Ambrose was out to show that he has not been a respecter of\npersons.\n\nAmbrose, unlike for instance Synesius, tells his correspondents little,\nor indeed most often nothing, about his own circumstances. He did not\nwrite letters in order to talk about what he was doing, or to explore his\nown feelings. This does not mean that he had no feelings. He enjoyed\nletter-writing as a form of companionship. So he writes to Sabinus: ‘I am\nnever less alone than when I seem to be so. For then I summon at pleas-\nure whom I will, and associate to myself those whom I love most or find\nmost congenial, and no man interrupts or intrudes upon us.?” But what\nhe enjoyed in correspondence with friends was the discussion of prob-\nlems posed by the Bible, not exchanges of information about each other's\nbusiness.\n\nHere are some of the problems discussed in letters: in the frst letter of\nthe collection, Ambrose interprets a sentence from Exodus which com-\nmands that in a time of plague each Israelite should give halfa drachma as\na ransom for his life to the Lord.** How can a benevolent God say: ‘J put\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n* Many of the dates of the edition of the Maurist Fathers are unreliable: Palanque 1931: 480-556, as\nare those still cited in Beyenka 1967.\n\n» E.g. in Book VIN, Epp. 58 (M60), 59 (M84), 60 (Myo), 61 (M89).\n\n6 Cloero, De off yaa.

When assigning letters to the later books, Ambrose\nwas evidently more concerned with achieving variety, as regards both\naddressees and subject matter. The collection was not to be read as an\nautobiography or a history, but as an anthology.*®\n\nThe letters of Book 1 are addressed to different individuals, but every\none includes allegorical interpretations of biblical texts derived from\nPhilo, the Jewish philosopher writing in Alexandria in the first century.%\nA great part of Book 1 has evidently been lost, but many of the argument\nof two of its four letters are again derived from Philo.” Book 11 is miss-\ning. Six of the seven letters in Book rv are addressed to Irenaeus. One\nletter (Ep. 14) once more makes use of Philo.* Some of the allegorical\ninterpretations of Letters 12 and 13 are derived from works of Origen, the\nChristian philosophical theologian.» Letter 11 even has arguments derived\nfrom the pagan philosopher Plotinus.® Book v is made up of nine letters.\nOf these six are addressed to Orontianus, a cleric who had been ordained\nby Ambrose. All are concerned with the soul, its route to salvation and the\nstuff it is made of, and all the six make use of allegorical interpretations o.\nthe Bible derived from Origen.“ However each of the book's last three letters\nhas a different subject. Letter 24 (M82) shows Ambrose acting as an arbitra-\ntor. Letter 25 (Ms3) is addressed to the emperor Theodosius I in 392/3, and\ndeals with the burial of Valentinian II, while the last letter (Ep. 26 [Ms4]),\nis addressed to a friend. So the letter to the emperor has not been given any\npositional prominence.\n\nThe contents of Book v1 are various. Four letters are to Sabinus, bishop\nof Placentia, a colleague whose literary and theological judgement Ambrose\nrespected. OF these, the letter which was certainly the last to be written as it\ncomments on the decision of Paulinus of Nola and his wife to give away their\nproperty as late as 395, is actually the first in the book. This letter turns into\na defence of asceticism. The second letter, which is addressed to Chromatius,\nbishop of Aquileia, has also been written late in Ambrose’s life.

The moral of the tale is said to be that it shows the high respect the\npeople of the Bible had for chastity and the passion they displayed in avenging\nits violation. The tone of the second letter is quite different from the first. The\nreader cannot avoid feeling that Ambrose is now inviting Syagrius to enjoy a\nsqualid horror story, expertly told in accordance with the rules which both\nbishops had learnt at school. Perhaps Ambrose realised that he had gone too\nfar, and that Syagrius had every right to resent the bishop of Milan’s interven-\ntion in his jurisdiction, and wrote a second letter in order to take some of the\nheat out of the situation, and to reconcile his colleague.

That this would be so is\nin fact signalled in the opening letter of Book 1, which dedicates the col-\nlection to Justus bishop of Lyons. For in this letter Ambrose describes the\ncorrespondence as fables in letter-form, and as a conversation at a distance\ndevoted to the interpretation of the heavenly oracle, that is of scripture.*°\nThe letter itself is a discussion of Ex. 30:12-16. All the subsequent five\nletters making up Book 1 concern problems of interpretation of biblica\ntexts; and biblical texts dominate Books mi-vi and 1x. They are less prom-\ninent in Books vu and vu, but they are present there too. They are absent\nonly from the political Book x.\n\nAmbrose’s interpretation is invariably allegorical. Augustine's account o.\nhis conversion illustrates why allegory was employed so widely in biblical\ncommentaries, sermons and dogmatic controversy in late antiquity an\nsubsequently. The young Augustine was strongly drawn to Christianity,\nnot least through the influence of Monica, his mother, but he was long\nheld back from full commitment by the fact the Bible included many pas-\nsages that seemed far from edifying. When he came to Milan and hear\nAmbrose interpreting such awkward passages allegorically, the difficulty\ndisappeared. “The Catholic faith ... I now concluded with myself, might\nwell be maintained without absurdity ... after I had heard one or two\nplaces of the Old Testament resolved ... which when I understood lit-\nwas slain.” The fact that Christianity is a religion of the Book\nwas an advantage it had over the traditional cults which originated in\npre-literate times. But fundamentalist interpretation raised difficulties -\nas it still does — which allegorical interpretation of the awkward passages\ncould, and can, by-pass.\ne difficulties which troubled Ambrose and his correspondents are\ngenerally not as fundamental as those that kept Augustine from becoming\na fully committed Christian. The Arian controversy, in which Ambrose\ntook so prominent and aggressive a part on the Nicene side, does not fig-\nure at all prominently in these discussions. Many of the questions seem to\nbe motivated by interest in the problem raised, rather than doubts threat-\nening the questioner’s faith, though some are about important questions\nof doctrine or conduct. Ambrose generally replies in a relaxed style which\nis quite different from the intense aggressiveness of his dogmatic writings.\nAmbrose learnt his allegorical technique from Philo, and, as we have seen,\n\n \n\n \n\nomy\n\nerally,\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8 Ep. 1 (M7), 1-2: ut epistulares fabulas et sermonem absentium ad interpretationem conferamus oraculi\ncaelestis,\n\n* Augustine, Conf v4, us.

For other letters Ambrose has derived interpretations\nmainly from Origen, or from the Latin translations of Origen made by\nJerome and Rufinus.” As we have seen, letters predominantly influenced\nby Philo are found in different books from those making use mainly of\nOrigen. Ambrose does not name Philo, Origen or Jerome, but it may well\nbe that Ambrose was inspired to write letters by reading particular works\nof one or other of these authors. It is also the case that while Ambrose\nappropriated many interpretations from his Greek sources, he has worked\nthem into a composition which is essentially his own, and he certainly\nalso enjoyed inventing striking and original interpretations himself.\n\nWhile these letters consist of a succession of exegetical material, they\ndo not provide a systematic interpretation of a single text. Ambrose uses\nhis correspondent’s request for information only as the starting-point for\na chain of moral or doctrinal reflections all backed up by citations from\nthe Bible, many to be understood allegorically, others literally. This pro-\ncedure demonstrates Ambrose’s formidable knowledge of the text of the\nBible, as well as remarkable sensitivity to the power of biblical language.\nThe sequence of allegories sometimes takes Ambrose a long way from his\noriginal problem. His procedure is not that of a scholar, but rather of a\npreacher, trying to preach a lively sermon. As one edifying admonition\nis followed by another and another and so on, it is often difficult to rec-\nognise any logical thread linking successive ideas. Ambrose was of course\namong other things a poet, and it might be said that he composed these\nletters as a poet composes poetry, and it was surely Ambrose the poet who\nwas impressed by the vivid, though quite unclassical imagery of the Bible,\nand enjoyed adopting biblical metaphors to illustrate and give authority\nto his own arguments.\n\nThere is a certain ambiguity about Ambrose’s use of biblical quota-\ntions in these letters. Ambrose, like all the Fathers of the church, believed\nthat the Bible was inspired by God.** Following Philo and Origen,* he\nassumed that it could be read not only for the information conveyed by\nthe literal meaning of its words, but for moral and doctrinal truths, which\n\na\n\nLucchesi 1977; Savon 1977.\n\n8: Epp. 18 (M70), 21 (M34) ¢ 23 (M36), 40 (M32), 63 (M73), 65 (M75), 69 (M72).\n\n& Hanson 1959: 186209, mainly about Origen’s reconciliation of inspiration and allegory.\n8° Hanson 1959: 45-53 (Philo), 162-86 (Origen).\n\nDownloaded from httpsi/Awww.cambridge.org/core.

Nevertheless when one reads some Ambrose’s more\nextravagant interpretations, one wonders whether he really believed that\nthey conferred more authority on his teaching than quotations from trad-\nitional Classics, above all from Virgil, were thought to give to the orations\nof secular orators.\n\nBook x\n\nBook x is different from the others in several respects. Its letters are exclu-\nsively concerned with historical events, and Ambrose the bishop is from\nthe beginning to the end at the centre of the narrative. Moreover, we are\nintroduced to a different Ambrose, not the good colleague, the caring pas-\ntor and above all che man to consult if you have a problem understanding\nthe Bible, but the fearless upholder of the rights of the church, ready to\ncontradict the highest authorities to prevent any concessions being made\nto pagans, sectarians or Jews. Book x is also much the longest book.\n\nThe first letter addressed to Theophilus, bishop of Alexandria in\n392, shows Ambrose as spokesman of western bishops assembled at the\nCouncil of Capua, asking Theophilus to broker an agreement between\ntwo rival claimants to the see of Antioch, and to end a dispute that had\nlong divided the church. In the second letter Ambrose, once again writ-\ning on behalf of the bishops assembled at Capua, calls on the bishops of\nMacedonia to investigate the case of Bonosus, bishop of Naisus (Nish) or\nperhaps of Serdica (Sofia), whom the bishops at Capua had found guilty\nof heresy and deposed.\n\nThere follows a dossier of documents which shows Ambrose the polit-\nician in action at the highest level of politics. In 384 Symmachus, prefect\nof the city of Rome and the chairman of the Roman senate, petitioned\nthe emperor Valentinian IH to restore to the senate chamber the Altar of\nVictory which had been removed in 357 by the pious Christian emperor\nConstantius I.

The affair of the Altar of Victory has often been seen as the\ndecisive engagement in a conflict of religions, signifying the final victory\nof Christianity over the traditional religion of Rome. It is, however, hardly\nnoticed by other writers of the period. It owes its fame to its presentation\nin the collection of Ambrose.\n\nThere follows a letter which Ambrose purports to have written ia win-\nter 388/9 to the emperor Theodosius I warning him neither to punish the\nparticipants in the burning of a synagogue in the frontier fortress city of\nCallinicum, nor to compel the local bishop to rebuild it. The letter, as we\nread it in the collection, implies that the bishop was at the time still under\norders to have the synagogue rebuilt. In fact careful reading of the letter\nshows that the emperor has already rescinded the order.8” Much of what\nAmbrose tells the emperor in this letter, the emperor evidently knows\nalready, and has even acted upon. It looks as if Ambrose has redacted the\noriginal letter to turn it into a full statement of Ambrose’s case, not only\nfor the emperor but for the record and to guide posterity.”\n\nThe last episode to be documented in the collection is a conflict\nbetween Ambrose and the imperial rulers of the West, Valentinian II and\nhis wife Justina, which was drawn out from around Easter 385 to Easter\n386. It arose over imperial support for an Arian bishop at Milan, and more\nspecifically over repeated demands that Ambrose should allow one of his\nchurches to be used for Arian services. Ambrose refused, organised a sit-in\nin the threatened church, got the besieged congregation to sing hymns,\nand displayed not only courage, but also great demagogic skill to prevail\nagainst the imperial authorities. The last document in the dossier describes\nthe discovery of relics of the martyrs Gervase and Protase which Ambrose\nevidently interpreted — or wished his readers to interpret — as a sign that\nGod approved the stand that he had taken.\n\nBook x is certainly not simply a collection of correspondence. The\nossier on the Altar of Victory includes a speech of Symmachus and a\n‘letter’ that is in fact a speech answering Symmachus’ speech.

The succession of documents\nbearing on the conflict of 385/6 is interrupted by a long oration on the\ndeath of the emperor Theodosius I, which happened nine years later.

Three extant manuscripts contain the collection in\nclose to its entirety and indicate that it did circulate as a whole.” Other\nmanuscripts contain many or most of the sermons.* The majority of\nEusebius Gallicanus manuscripts contain excerpts: groups of sermons\nfrom the collection, rather than the collection as a whole.’ Scholars who\nhave worked on the Eusebius Gallicanus conclude that it was circulating as\na collection by the sixth or seventh century, and perhaps earlier.” The\n\nAs well as works on specific preachers see, for example, T.

AL rights reserved.\n\nLetter 3°\n\nIntroduction\n\n    \n\nThe fourth century was a key period for the promotion of the ideal of consecrated virginity. Ambrose and, above all, Jorome stand out as essential figures in this effort, Indeed,\nJerome is sometimes extreme in his expressions, promoting virginity by the denigration of marriage. Augustine shares the view that in the spiritual hierarchy, the state of\nconsecrated virginity is superior to that of marriage. In turn, the state of consecrated widowhood is superior to the married state but inferior to the state of consecrated virginity. In\nterms of the Gospel parable, virginity yields fruit one hundred-fold, widowhood, sixty, and marriage only thirty. In earlier times, the martyr had been at the sammit of this spiritual\npyramid. But these were not the times of open persecution.\n\n   \n\n \n\n     \n\nable copyright tow.\n\n    \n\nLuse the word “state\" with good reason because Augustine was acutely aware that \"states of perfection\" as such did not guarantee the sanctity of individuals in them. In the\nlarger field of his views on the Church, while it was better to be a member of the Church than not to be one, this alone was no iron-clad guarantec of ultimate salvation. He never\ntired of repeating that there were some in the Church now who would not be found in the ultimate City of God in heaven and some not in the Church visibly now who would be\nsaved, (They would presumably have to find their way to the Church before their deaths.)\n\n \n\n \n\nSo, too, there were individual consecrated virgins and widows who were inferior spiritually to holy married women, Here one might compare this view with Jerome who in his\netter 22 to the young aspiring ascetic Eustochium, proclaimed that she should not mingle with married women since she was superior to them. (Jerome, ep. 22.16)\n\nstine, on the other hand, was quite aware that a prime danger for consecrated virgins was the temptation to pride. A good part of his treatise On Haly Virginity (FOTC 27) is\ndedicated to the consideration of this problem. At the beginning of the City of God, when he was searching for answers to the questions posed by bewildered Christians and\nsaucy pagans as to the reasons for Rome's apparent decline in power under Christian emperors, one objection thrown up to him concerned the rape of consecrated virgins by the\npillaging Goths.

Apparently, he worked as a notaries for\nAmbrose in the latter's final years, Ambrose's successor, the neoplatonist philosopher-priest, Simplicianus, invited Paulinus to go to North Africa to supervise the property of the\nchurch of Milan, presumably estates and plantations. He went and spent many years there. His letter to Augustine probably was written in Africa. Making his acquaintance,\nAugustine asked him to write about Ambrose, The usual date given for this biographical work is c. 422.\n\n       \n \n   \n\n \n\n   \n\nWhat Paulinus is asking for is not entirely clear but it seems that the question involves a sort of “lives of the saints,” ie, martyrs, by Augustine. This is not as unusual as it may\nsound, After all, he also wrote a summary book of heresies when asked by Quodvultdeus (De haeresibus 428-429; cf. ep, 221 of c. 426-427). In this case, however, Augustine\nwisely declined. He had preached many sermons on the martyrs but he felt he could not match the powerful simplicity of the passiones themselves. His own contribution here lay\n\n       \n\n   \n\nprimarily with theology and spirituality rather than hagiography and history. It is not clear what works of Ambrose he is referring to in ep. 29\" 2, lines 1-4.\n\nDate\n\n \n\nOn the presupposition that Paulinus‘ life of Ambrose was written c. 422, Divjak argues that this letter was written before that date. Duval argues, however, that this date is\nlate and the date for the Vita should be 412-413. While he does not specify a date, he ventures the belief that this letter is posterior to the Vita.\n\n \n\nAugustine sends greetings in the Lord to his most beloved and most sincere son and fellow deacon, Paulinus:'\n\n \n\n© On Paulinus see DPAC IL, col\n\n \n\n. 2607-08, M.

During his reign: Theodosius held the Council of 150 Bishops\nin Constantinople concerning the consubstantiality of the Holy Spirit.\n\nEqually the emperor Theodosius promoted as praetorian prefect\nAntiochos nicknamed Chouzon, the Elder, originally from Antioch the\nGreat. As soon 48 he was promoted to prefect, he reported to the\nemperor Theodosius that the great city of Antioch in Syria had spread\nout and increased in size, and had many buildings extending up to 4 mile\noutside its walls, Then the emperor Theodosius ordered that the houses\noutside the city should also be surrounded by a wall. A wal] was built\nfrom the gate know as the Philonauta to the place known as Rhodion:\nthe new wall enclosed the mountain as far as the old wall built by\nTiberius Caesar, He extended the new wall as far as the stream known as\nPhyrminos, which runs down from a ravine in the mountain: he brought\nthe stone down from the old monomacheron, which was up on the acropolis.\nHe also pulled down the aqueduct leading to the acropolis from what. are\nknown as the Waters of the Road to Laodikeia. Julius Caesar had built\nthis aqueduct when he built the public bath (347) up on the mountain for\nthe people known as the Akropolitai, those who had remained living up\nthere together with those whom Seleukos Nikator the Macedonian brought\ndeen to the city founded by him in the srea known as the Valley, those\nwhom he asked to live with him in the city below, Antioch the Great.\n\nAt that time Gindaros, Lytargon and many other small Syrian towns\nwere also provided with walls,\n\n41. During his reign the Tzannoi crossed over into Cappadocia,\nCilicia and Syria, plundering them and withdrawing again.\n\n42, The emperor Theodosius created the province of Nova Epirus,\ndividing it off from the Old, granting the status of city and a governor\nto the city of DPyrrachium. Likewise he divided off Second Palestine\nfrom the First and created a province, giving the status of a\nmetropolis and a governor to the place known as Skythopolis.\n\n43, The emperor Theodosius left Constantinople for Rome and entered\nthe city of Thessalonike. The military force which was with him\ncaused an uproar in the city over billeting, and so the inhabitants of\nThessalonike rioted and insulted the emperor; and when he was watching\nthe races in the city with the hippodrome full, he ordered his archers\nto shoot. at the crowd and as many as 15,000 were killed. Bishop\nAmbrose was angry with him because of this and placed him under\ninterdict, He remained many days (348) sithout entering the church,\nuntil the bishop was persuaded to receive him at the feast. of the Holy\nNativity. But. he only agreed to receive him when he had issued an\nimperial reseript that, in any case of imperial displeasure, whatever\nits nature, a remission should be granted by the arbitrators for 30 days\nand only then should the sentence he carried out.\n\n40.

            "result": "64 em Yitzhak Hen\n\nNeedless to say, the leaders of the Christian Church in Italy were not happy with\nthis notion of Remanitas, and shortly after Symmachus’ letter reached the court of\nValentinian II, who resided in Milan at the time, Ambrose, the bishop of Milan,\nlaunched a formal and vicious assault on paganism, and on members of the senato-\nrial elite who tried to defend it.** This is not the place to rehearse the various argu-\nments raised by Ambrose in response to Symmachus’ petition. It should suffice to\nmention here that for Ambrose, as for Symmachus, Rome was indeed the greatest\ncity of the Empire. But, according to Ambrose, its claim to greatness was not its\npagan past, but its Christian present.” Rome’s importance did not depend on its glo-\nrious pagan past or its political position, but on the fact that it became a Christian\ncentre that was founded by two apostles.*° This new insight gave Romanitas a signif-\nicant Christian twist, and although it was not felt immediately, it gradually became\nstandard throughout the West.\n\nIn the fifth century, although stripped of real power, Rome the city, the ancient\ncapital of the Empire, still symbolized auctorifas and stood at the centre of the sen-\natorial elite’s self-perception. It was, for example, an integral part of Sidonius Apol-\nlinaris’ Romanitas.* He visited Rome many times; he was the praefectus urbis in 468/\n9; and he praised its beauty in his poems and letters.” In that respect, Sidonius’\nsense of Romanitas was very similar to that of Praetextatus’, and the only difference\nbetween them is the fact that unlike Praetextatus, who collected religious affiliations\nand priesthoods, Sidonius Apollinaris ended his life as the bishop of Clermont.”\nThings, it appears, had changed dramatically, yet religious service, albeit in a Chris-\ntian context, still remained a crucial component of the elite’s sense of duty and def-\ninition of Romanitas.\n\nA century after Sidonius the balance between Rome’s political prestige and its\nChristian disposition had shifted altogether. Although the ancient glory of the city\nas the capital of the Empire did not fade away, especially not in the writings of illus-\ntrious representatives of the provincial senatorial elite, the auctoritas of Rome was\nmostly derived from the papal see. If we examine, for instance, when and where\nGregory of Tours mentions Rome in his Books of History, the point becomes even\nclearer. Rome is first mentioned when Gregory tells how Peter arrived there.*\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n28 Wytzes 1977, 29-47, Alan Cameron 2011, 39-51; C.

Gregory is indifferent\nto the fact that Rome was once the capital of an empire, and he refers to it inciden-\ntally as the residence of the senate.’° The conquest of Rome by Alaric and the Goths,\nto which Augustine devoted much thought and his monumental De civitate Dei, is\nmentioned by Gregory in passing while discussing the sources for the reign of Clo-\nvis.” It is obvious that although Gregory calls Rome ipsa urbs urbium et totius\nmundi caput ingens (‘that city of cities and the mighty head of the whole world’),\nhis attitude towards Rome was utterly Christian, echoing Ambrose’s response to\nSymmachus.\n\nThis Christian takeover is also reflected in the terminology used by Gregory. In\nhis book On the Glory of the Martyrs, to give just one example, Gregory writes that\nthe Visigoths Romanos enim vocitant nostrae homines relegionis (‘refer to the men\nof our religion as Romans’). On the other hand, he uses the adjective barbarus\nas a synonym for paganus, implying that the relation between barbarus and Roma-\nnus has changed from a cultural to a religious one.** Romanus for Gregory denoted\nreligious affiliation, and the contrast between barbarus and Romanus therefore par-\nalleled the contrast between ‘Catholic’ and ‘Arian’ or ‘Christian’ and ‘pagan’. Hence,\nwhen Gregory and other members of the Gallo-Roman senatorial elite called them-\nselves ‘Roman’, they were defining their status — or rather their Romanitas — in Chris-\ntian terms.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, equating Christianitas with Romanitas in the post-Roman barbarian\nworld was a double-edged sword. Did Romanitas also cover unorthodox forms of\nChristianity? Or, in other words, was Arianism also a form of Romanitas?” Ambrose\n\n \n\n \n\n36 Gregory of Tours, Decem libri historiarum, 1, 32, ed.

His incompetence as a deacon under Ambrose led to his\ndeposition and flight to Constantinople. In the Eastern capital, he managed\nto insinuate himself among influential men at the court. He received his epis-\ncopal see at Nicomedia in exchange for securing a post in the emperor’s ser-\nvice for another bishop’s son.”” If we are to believe the surviving record, the\nreign of Constantine does not seem to have resulted in a diminution in the\nnumber of bishops who came from modest backgrounds. We must assume\nthat, in addition to those cases listed above, this was especially true for bish-\nops in smaller cities and in remote region!\n\nTo a large degree, the selection of the higher clergy was a direct result of\nthe pool of available candidates. This led to significant regional variations.\nThe correspondence between the social origin of the clergy and the general\nsocial demographics of a region can best be illustrated for Roman North\nAfrica. Most of the 275 bishops listed in André Mandouze’s Prosopographie\nchrétienne du Bas-Empire were of curial background. Only two, possibly three,\nbishops were senators: Cyprian of Carthage (a doubtful case), Petilianus,\nthe Donatist bishop of Cirta, and Fulgentius of Ruspe. This is partly due to\nthe relative paucity of senators in Africa, and partly due to the dense pattern\nof urbanization, which yielded large numbers of curiales. A further need for\nclergy in North Africa was occasioned by the existence of a parallel, Donatist\nhierarchy. As a result, the number of episcopal sees in North Africa\namounted to at least 500, if not 1,000, at the end of the fourth and begin-\nning of the fifth century. Not all these positions could be filled with candi-\ndates from the highest echelons of society.” In fact, quite a significant num-\nber of North African bishops came from the lower class of coloni, tenant\nfarmers, whose education was little more than rudimentary.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEDU\n\n \n\nATION\n\n \n\nThe church did not make higher education a requirement for candidacy for\nthe episcopate but was content with basic literacy among the higher clergy.\nThe Apostolic Constitutions pay more attention to the character traits required\n\n36.

Ambrose exemplifies the\nformer, Paulinus of Nola the latter.\n\nAmbrose’s appointment to the episcopal see of Milan in 374 set the prec-\nedent for senatorial bishops in Italy.®! His father had been praetorian pre-\nfect of the Gauls in 339/340, and he himself had until then held the posi-\ntion of consudaris of Aemilia and Liguria.” Ambrose represents the pattern\nof the senator who exchanged a high position in the imperial service for the\nighest office of the church.\n\nPaulinus of Nola followed a different path. The son of a very distin-\nguished family, he had held the governorship of Campania. But then he sur-\nrised his contemporaries with his decision to shun his brilliant career pros-\n\n  \n\n \n\nects, dispose of his substantial wealth, and pursue a life of asceticism. In\n394, he was ordained to the priesthood, but it would not be until over a\ndecade later that he was appointed bishop of Nola, a position he held for\nmore than twenty years (409/410 to 431). Jerome applauded Paulinus\nwith a wordplay on the concept of nobilitas: “nobilem te ecclesia habeat, ut\nprius senatus habuit.”*\n\nThe sequence of distinguished career, ascetic conversion, and gradual\npromotion through the ranks of the clergy, exemplified by Paulinus of Nola,\nis still in evidence in Italy in the sixth century. By this period, Christianity\nhad firmly taken root, and many aristocratic families could proudly look\nack on their ancestors’ impressive record in the service of the church.\nGregory the Great is a case in point. He came from a prominent senatorial\nfamily, but his ancestry also boasted one, if not two bishops of Rome: his\ngreat-great-grandfather Felix, and perhaps Pope Agapetus as well. Gregory\nhad advanced to the office of city prefect of Rome, but then, in his mid-thir-\nties, withdrew from the public life to dedicate himself to the pursuit of\nmonasticism. A few years later, he was ordained deacon and was soon sent\nas a papal legate to Constantinople. After his recall to Rome, he returned to\nhis monastic life, until in 590, he was appointed bishop of Rome, a position\nheld until his death in Go4.%\nFour lesser-known Italian bishops probably also came from senatorial\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfamilies.

The following\nremarks therefore aim to bring into focus the most important patterns, but\nmake no claim to completeness. Since the breakdown of the Roman ma-\nchinery of government at end of the fourth century as a result of immigra-\ntion and intermittent warfare, men of senatorial background were ap-\npointed to the episcopate in ever-increasing numbers. By the fifth century,\nthis trend was well established. Deprived of access to the emperor as a\nsource of dispensation of honors and distinctions, these men found in the\nepiscopal office an opportunity to maintain their prominent role in local\nsociety and to continue in activities that were associated with and expected\ny their status, most particularly public benefactions through building\npatronage and the provision of public entertainments, and the leisure to\nengage in literary pursuits. This overlap of aristocratic markers of social emi-\nnence with Christian good works contributes to the development of the holy\nishop of noble background as a type in Latin hagiography.\n\nEspecially in the late fourth and fifth centuries, many bishops of senato-\nrial background in Gaul attained their appointment, just like their col-\nleagues in the pars Orientis, after many years in office in the civil adminis-\ntration. Often, the episcopate was conferred on them directly, without prior\nexperience in ecclesiastical office—confirmation of the ease with which so-\ncial status could be translated into ecclesiastical rank. An early example of\na locally prominent senator-turned-bishop is Claudius Lupicinus, bishop of\nVienne. He had been a vir consularis in the 380s, and his civic benefactions\nwere commemorated in several honorific inscriptions.'!° This pattern con-\ntinued in the fifth century. Sidonius Apollinaris’s father and grandfather\nhad held the praetorian prefecture of the Gauls, and his wife was the daugh-\nter of the future emperor Avitus. Sidonius himself was city prefect of Rome\nin 468. Soon thereafter, back in Gaul, he was ordained bishop of Clermont\nin 470 and exercised his duties with great dedication and diligence until his\ndeath in 487.1\"! Germanus became bishop of Auxerre under circumstances\nnot too dissimilar from those that brought Ambrose to the episcopate.\nWhile he was holding a high office, probably the governorship of the\nprovince Lugdunensis Quarta, he was ordained to the priesthood and des-\nignated as the next successor to the episcopal see of that city, which he\nwould hold for thirty years, from 418 to 448.' The direct conferral of the\nepiscopal dignity on former officeholders honored and asserted their exist-\ning social status while shifting the arena in which they wielded their power.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13:0.

In the same\nmanner, the short-lived Western emperor Avitus was deposed in 456 and\nmade bishop of Piacenza,!’ and Glycerius’s deposition after only one year\nas Western emperor was followed by his appointment to the episcopal see of\nSalona in 474.1\"\n\nAt the same time, however, the tradition of men who passed through the\nintermediary stage of monasticism before they became bishops continued\non into the early fifth century, in Gaul as much as elsewhere. Eucherius of\nLyon, the author of the monastic treatise In Praise of the Desert, for example,\nhailed from a senatorial family. Together with his wife and two daughters, he\ntook up a monastic retreat on the island of Lérins, while entrusting the edu-\ncation of his two sons to the bishops Honoratus and Hilarius. He later\nbecame bishop of Lyon, probably in 434.1%\n\nBeginning with the last decades of the fifth century, a third pattern of\nepiscopal recruitment from the senatorial aristocracy emerges. Until now,\nwe have encountered the direct transition from secular to ecclesiastical ca-\nreer exemplified by Ambrose of Milan and the episcopal appointment pre-\nceded by monastic practice, as in the case of Paulinus of Nola and many of\nthe fourth-century curiales. Now for the first time we encounter men of dis-\ntinguished background whose careers evolved entirely within the context of\nthe church.\"* Christianity had now permeated all aspects of Gallic society,\nand the region had politically become detached from Italy. Consequently,\nfamily traditions of gaining distinction through civic office or public bene-\nfactions found a new venue in the church as an institution. Men of promi-\nnent background who were appointed as bishops could thus enjoy a newly\ndefined position of eminence, while at the same time continuing to bestow\ntheir patronage on their civitas. Gregory of Tours is a prime example of this\npattern. He came from a senatorial family of great wealth. On his father’s\nside, the family could trace its descent from the senator Vettius Epagathus,\none of the martyrs of Lyon in 177. His father’s uncle had been a priest, and\nhis father’s brother was a bishop. His mother’s side of the family had in the\nlast two generations produced one senator and at least five bishops.

Already the Council of Nicaea\nisted that a suitable time must elapse between baptism and ordination to\nthe priesthood or the episcopate. A few decades later, the Council of Sardica\ndeclared that wealthy men or men with extensive legal training, scholastici tes\nagoras, should not become bishops immediately but had to rise through the\necclesiastical ranks.!®4 Still in the sixth century, Justinian found it necessary\nto endorse the observation of proper procedure in ecclesiastical appoint-\nments.'*> Nevertheless, when the need arose, ecclesiastical ritual could serve\nas a substitute for the proper interstices. Such was the case with Ambrose,\nwho received baptism, “all the ecclesiastical offices,” and ordination to the\nepiscopate, all within the course of one week.’ The preference for men\nwith abundant worldly qualifications, but without a firm grounding in the\nfaith or without much experience in ecclesiastical matters, did not go un-\ncriticized. Jerome, for one, noted sarcastically: “Yesterday a catechumen,\ntoday a priest. Yesterday at the theatre, today in the church. In the evening\nat the chariot-races, the next morning at the altar. Recently a fan of actors,\nnow a consecrator of holy virgins.”!\"\n\nins\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\nTHE PERMEABILITY OF CIVIC AND ECCLESIASTICAL OFFICE\n\nFor many upwardly mobile curiales, the episcopate was the crowning glory of\ntheir public career.

So he\nsuffered many trials under the Provincial Governor Diogenes, trying to give\nup his service while adhering to the faith of the Christians.

Libanius thus redeems the city from the negative\nimage of the Misopogon. But the Presbeutikos does more than that: it also presents a\nvery positive image of both Libanius himself and Julian. Indeed, Libanius appears from\nthe text not only as a close friend and advisor of Julian’s, but also as a free-speaking\ndefender of Antioch.?* The former is shown to have useful results, in that Libanius has\nJulian say that it was actually the orator who solved the food shortage (15.8). The latter\nis demonstrated by Libanius’ readiness, towards the end of the text (15.83), to link his\nfate as a sophist to his success in convincing Julian with the Presbeutikos. Spoken after\nJulian’s death, these words did not entail any real risk for Libanius, but they did show\ncommitment to his city and confidence in his oratory. Especially at a time when Julian’s\nreligious reforms were being turned back and Julian’s followers were being removed\nfrom positions of power, stressing his independence from Julian as well as the usefulness\nof his oratory may have been a wise step — especially for someone who was widely\nseen as too much the deceased emperor’s man in Antioch.%” At the same time, however,\nthis presentation was also to Julian’s credit: in one of the tropes of panegyric, it was\nacceptable for emperors to be carried away by anger as long as they were willing to\nlisten to free-spoken council and come back on decisions taken under the spur of\nanger.°® Nobody knew, of course, what Julian’s response to the Presbeutikos would\nhave been, but the suggestion in the speech that Julian was willing to listen to Libanius\nboded well. The Presbeutikos therefore comes as close as was still possible after Julian’s\ndeath to removing the single blot on Julian’s career in Libanius’ eyes. In a more subtle\nand implicit, but not less well-targeted way than the explicitly commemorative Orations\n17 and 18, Libanius’ performance of the Presbeutikos after Julian’s death thus tries to\nmould the audience’s interpretation of Julian’s stay in Antioch.\n\nMore than five years after the composition of the Presbeutikos,?? Libanius would go\neven further in absolving Julian in his Epitaphios (18.195-9). The reason for this was\nthat, while the wound inflicted on Antioch by Julian’s Misopogon had already had some\ntime to heal, in the new political climate under Valens, it might now have been Julian\nrather than Antioch who risked being seen in a negative light because of the Misopogon.\nIn a speech designed explicitly to shape the memory of Julian’s reign as a whole,\nLibanius therefore absolves Julian of any wrong-doing by saying that Julian applied the\npunishment not of a tyrant, but of an orator. According to the Epitaphios, then, the\nMisopogon shows not so much the emperor’s anger, but his control of it, Like Orations\n16 and 15, the Epitapbios was originally delivered for a small public!°® and may\ntherefore not have had a great impact initially. In due course, however, the Epitaphios\nwould become a key document for historians of the following decades, offering, as it\ndid, a full account of Julian’s life.!°! Combined with Julian’s very similar presentation of\nevents in the Misopogon, Libanius’ Epitaphios proved irresistible to most of them.\n\n°° Closeness is emphasized in Or. 15.6-13 and 82-6. Free speech (noppnoia) is claimed in Or, 15.12-13.\n\n°7 Jul, Mis. 354c claims Libanius as one of his own; for the suspicions, see Lib., Ep. 815 (Foerster) = 10x\n(Norman). Libanius had actively sought the patronage of Julian (see Wiemer, op. cit. (n. 4), 77-187), so\nresentment was not surprising.\n\n%® See Lib., Or. 19 and 20; Soz., Hist, eccl. 7.23.2-3. The embellished accounts of the anger of Theodosius I, the\nmassacre in Thessalonica, and his subsequent repentance (a.D. 390) have the aim of saving the emperor through\nthis panegyrical device (Ruf., Hist. eccl. 11.18; Paulin., V.

For Krautheimer, Rome refused to\nbecome Constantine’s Christian capital, and this was an important reason for\nthe emperor's decision “to abandon the West altogether” and set up a capital at\nByzantium.” Nonetheless, Krautheimer saw a pagan-Christian conflict as over\nby the end of the fourth century, from which point he saw the city as “under\npapal rule”.”' his description of the bishop of Rome as “de facto ruler of Rome\nin the fifth century”” is seriously challenged by Mark Humphries.”\n\n4. CHRISTIAN CAPITALS\n\nIt is now possible to paint a far more nuanced picture of Rome as a “Christian\ncapital,” and several chapters in this book illuminate the picture still further.\nAgain, we know significantly less about Constantinople in the fourth and fifth\ncenturies, but it is clear that the shape of Christianity in these two cities also\ndiffered greatly. The cities’ respective statuses as Christian capitals were of\ncourse highly unequal, at least at the start of our period. Whatever we think of\nEusebius’ claim that in Constantinople, Constantine created a city free from\nidol worship (VC 3.47), it is clear that the pagan past was far less prominent in\nthe New Rome than in the old. As discussed above, the “Christianization” of\nthe city of Rome has been the subject of a great deal of scholarship and can be\nlooked at from a wide range of perspectives, taking in a host of sources, archae-\nological as well as literary. We know very little indeed about the Christian\ncommunity in Byzantium, but it seems likely it was small and lacking in\nimportance, even on a local scale, with no particular traditions of its own that\nsurvived, That is, Constantinople also lacked a significant Christian past.\n\nFor example, Constantinople was lacking in prominent martyrs, though\nthere were two local ones, Mokios and Akakios. In 356-57 Constantius II\nmoved apostolic—and therefore world-class—relics of Timothy, Luke, and\nAndrew to Constantinople.” This was a clear attempt to give Constantinople\nmore clout as a holy city, and further prestigious relic translations would follow\nunder Theodosius I.” The activities of Ambrose in providing martyrs for the\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n90.

He did not face the emperor along\nwith the support of the people, as Ambrose of Milan had against Theodosius I,\nwhen Arcadius refused to attend the Christmas service in 403 (and then the\nEaster one as well) and forbade him entrance to church.” Significantly, John’s\nstrongest weapon, his sermons, was of no avail in this conflict as the imperial\ncouple hardly ever were present to listen to them. On the contrary, his enemies\ncould easily distort his words when reporting them at court. Socrates also sug-\ngests a legalist streak in John’s character, in that throughout the troubles of his\nepiscopacy he respected procedures and rules. But being in the right is of little\navail: one has to be publicly recognized in having justice on one’s side. And\nthat demanded, I suggest, the skill to play the ritual game.

What was\ndifferent, however, was the location of the conflict: Constantinople. ohn’s\nconflict with Eudoxia illustrates how ceremonies were not merely well-staged\nexercises in public relations for the emperor: as much as occasions for the dis-\nplay of imperial and ecclesiastical virtue, they could be occasions for challenge\nand competition, entailing the possibility of gain and the risk of defeat.\nPersonality probably more than ideology (both John and Eudoxia are depicted\nas hard-headed and stubborn) made it hard for both to develop a balanced,\npublic relationship.

The celebrations\nat Rome, if such they were, would not have been without sharp political an-\nimus; an unprecedented visit by the emperor of the east to the urbs aeterna,\nspiritual heartland of the western empire. The vivid combination of Pacatus’\npersonal elation and his professed devotion to Theodosius is apparent from his\nopening chapter to his close. At the outset he attempts an elaborate conceit\n(Pan. Lat. 2(12).1.2):\n\nnam cum te semper ultra omnes retro principes laudari oportuerit, nunc\nporro ultra quam alias praedicatus es in ea urbe conveniat dicendo cele-\nbrari, cuius et libertatem armatus adservisti et auxisti dignitatem toga-\ntus, quo tandem modo consequi maiestatem utriusque vestrum oratione\nmea potero hoc praecipue in tempore, quo ita mutuo ambo crevistis, ut\nnec tu fueris adhuc maior nec illa felicior?\n\nFor since it was right before to praise you beyond all emperors, from\nnow on let it be proper to celebrate you in speech, more than you have been\nacclaimed in other places, in that city whose liberty you have defended\nunder arms and whose dignity you have increased wearing a toga; how\nwill I be able to match the majesty of both of you in my speech, particu-\nlarly at this time when both of you [ie Theodosius and Rome] have so\ngrown together that you have never been greater and the city more blessed?\n\nIt is a commonplace of panegyric for the speaker at the outset to confess\nrhetorical inadequacy, but Pacatus’ words here have very topical urgency, in-\nvigorating a potentially hackneyed formula. The exaltation of Theodosius ele-\nvates him beyond his fellow emperor, Valentinian II; and his presence in\nRome is presented as the culmination of his and the city’s glory. At the speech’s\nclose, Pacatus reprises the sentiment of the inextricability of emperor and city\nin sharper, more explicit terms (Pan.Lat. 2(12).475):\n\n \n\n \n\nRomam vidi, Theodosium vidi, et utrumque simul vidi; vidi illum prin-\ncipis patrem, vidi illum principis vindicem, vidi illum principis restitu-\ntorem!\n\n \n\nI have seen Rome, I have seen Theodosius, and I have seen both of\nthem together; 1] have seen that father of an emperor, I have seen that\navenger of an emperor, I have seen that restorer of an emperor.\n\n31.

Little had\nchanged two years later: the orator (perhaps the same man”) notes how Rome,\nagain the gentium domina and now also the sedes imperii (“seat of empire,”\n12.1~2), had strained to catch a glimpse of the emperors when they met in\nMilan. In the closing lines, the speaker foresees Maximian’s victory in a forth-\ncoming sea battle with Carausius in terms of the naval trophies that will adorn\nthe rostra at Rome, an imaginative conceit weakened by his location of the ros-\ntra in the Campus Martius (9.6”)—again it seems, an appeal to Rome as the\nrightful place of empire was irresistible, even if some of the detail was shaky.\n\nThe diversorum vii document the response of the provincial elite to a\nchanging political landscape over a thirty-year period, starting a century\nbefore Pacatus included them in his collection. What precisely Rome meant to\nGaul in those three decades of change is impossible to say, other than that the\nseven speeches in various ways share a vague and sometimes naive dedication\nto the city as the heartland of their cultural identity and political loyalty, even\nwhen occupied by a hostile party. None is as direct or insistent as the capital\ncity panegyrics in the collection, but together they are indicative of Gaul’s en-\nduring commitment, even when facing adversity, to the idea and reality of\nRome; but when seen in the context of the framing speeches 4(0) and 12(9)\ncelebrating the battle of the Milvian Bridge, the commitment to the idea and\nreality of Rome is seen to be conditional—conditional that is, on the right em-\nperor controlling the city. This was, of course, the perfect principle for Pacatus\nto be seen to be supporting. The diversorum vii are ideally placed to set the\nprecedent.\n\n \n\n3.

His two sons were already full Augusti: Arcadius, who had\nbeen left in Constantinople, since 383, and Honorius, who had been with Theo-\ndosius in Milan, since 393. They now took over territorial responsibility for the\neast and the west respectively. The age of the emperors (17/18 and 10 at accession\nto sole rule) seriously weakened the imperial office: neither showed much incli-\nnation or any ability to assert control over their governments subsequently. De\nfacto Arcadius remained under the control of the eastern praetorian prefect\nRufinus, and Honorius now came under that of Stilicho. But Stilicho alleged\nthat Theodosius had commended the guardianship of both sons to his care,\nwhich neither Rufinus nor his successors at the eastern court were willing to\naccept. When Rufinus was lynched in November 395 by troops returning from\nthe west, the strings of the puppet Arcadius came under the control of Eutro-\npius, the eunuch chamberlain. Claudian’s poems are an eloquent, but deeply\npartial, source of information for the period. As early as his panegyric for the\nthird consulship of Honorius in 396 he insists forcefully on Stilicho’s right to\nact as guardian of the eastern as well as the western emperor, and this remains\na constant motif thereafter (3Cos. 151~53).’\n\nYet more interesting is the series of epic invectives which he launched at\naround the same time. First came two books against Rufinus, the first de-\nscribing his villain’s origins as an emissary of hell, sent to destroy the Roman\nstate, and the second recounting his fall after attempting to thwart Stilicho\n(and naturally much of the action, including the lynching, is set in Constanti-\nnople). The next crisis to be recorded was the war against Gildo, magister mili-\ntum of Africa and a native prince, who in 397 had attempted to change the\nallegiance of the African diocese from the western to the eastern part of the\nempire. This was a threat to both western prestige and Rome’s food supply, and\nStilicho had him declared a public enemy (of the eastern court’s matching dec-\nlaration of Stilicho as hostis publicus we hear not a word from Claudian). The\nwestern court’s grievance against the east is still carefully understated in the\nfirst book against Gildo: the deified emperor Theodosius visits the dreaming\nArcadius in Constantinople, while his father Count Theodosius simultaneously\nvisits Honorius in Milan, so that any suggestion of serious division between the\ncourts is neutralized. After the swift resolution of that crisis (so swift that there\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7, Claudian’s great nineteenth-century editor Birt, xxviii, thought that this claim was invented\nby Claudian, but it is taken for granted by Ambrose in the funeral oration (De Ob. Theod. 5), only\nforty days after Theodosius’ death.\n\nGRIG-Chapter 11-Page Proof 243 December 3, 2011 1:23 AM\n\f"

Meletius, bishop of\nAntioch, died soon after the council began, and discussions concerning his suc-\ncessor proved viciously divisive, not least because of Gregory's intervention on\nbehalf of a candidate favored by Rome and the west, but by very few in the east.\nTimothy, bishop of Alexandria, was only summoned after the council had\nalready begun and apparently also found himself at odds with the majority as\nsoon as he arrived.\" Gregory describes the “bitter wind from the west” that Tim-\nothy whipped up, in concert with allies “from Macedonia’; other sources to\nallow us to reduce this Macedonian contingent to the solitary figure of Acholius\nof Thessalonica, who is attested as a close ally of Damasus of Rome.’ A collateral\nvictim of this west wind was Gregory himself. He presents himself as a conve-\nnient target for the newcomers’ animosity against the eastern bishops who had\nconsecrated him, the object of pettifogging challenges to his eligibility for the\nsee, which finally drove him to resign after only about a month in office.\nDespite the access they enjoyed to the most promising talents of the whole\neastern church (Constantinople must have been full of eligible presbyters at-\ntending their bishops), the council then replaced Gregory with an unbaptized\nlayman, the genial senator Nectarius. As already noted, yet another bishop of\nConstantinople was dealt with in the council’s fourth and final canon, con-\ncerning “Maximus the Cynic and the disturbance which had happened over\nhim at Constantinople.” This declared that Maximus, whose attempted coup\nand ignominious expulsion the previous year Gregory also chronicled, was not\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nnow, nor had ever been, a genuine bishop.\n\nThese twists in conciliar politics must obviously be relevant to the formula-\ntion of the canons. Because our sources keep the council’s legislation separate\nfrom its politics, however, we can only guess at the relationship between the\ntwo. Socrates and Sozomen themselves faced the same problem, and they\nsolved it by placing the production of the canons at the end of the council, after\nNectarius had been happily enthroned (Socrates HE 5,8.12-13; Sozomen HE\n7.9.1). That this was only a guess is clear from Sozomen’s account of Canon 4,\nwhen he evidently supposes the abortive consecration of Maximus to have\nbeen attempted during the council, as an attempt by the Egyptian delegation\nto install a zealous Nicene during the vacancy (presumably) after Gregory’s\n\n \n\n14.

Although\nof Egyptian origin, Maximus was not an Egyptian cleric but a long-term resi-\ndent of Constantinople, who had made his pitch to Peter while visiting Alexan-\ndria as a representative of the Nicene community. He is more plausibly seen,\nthen, as a tenacious freelancer. The support that he received from Peter was\nonly provisional: Maximus was left to fight his own battles, and was shrugged\noff when he lost these.”* Nor is there any reason to believe that Maximus would\nhave reduced Constantinople to an Alexandrian satellite had his coup suc-\nceeded, any more than his (temporarily triumphant) rival Gregory subjected it\nto Cappadocian interests. Modern research has meanwhile steadily chipped\naway at fourth-century Alexandria’s traditional reputation for doctrinaire in-\nterventionism: a recent paper has reduced the most notorious example—their\nsupport for the Antiochene anti-bishop Paulinus—to a negotiation tactic.”\nThe church of Alexandria was arguably more plotted against than plotting\nthroughout the fourth century, and there is no evidence that it cast any signif-\nicant shadow over Constantinople before Theophilus marched against Chryso-\nstom.”* Alexandria was in no position to impose itself upon the 381 council: the\nlist of signatories includes only two Egyptian bishops, Timothy and the bishop\n\nof Oxyrhynchus, and although a large corps of invisible suffragans is often as-\n26\n\n \n\nsumed in their train, there is no basis whatever for such an assumption.” It is\n\ntherefore for advocates of an anti-Alexandrian tendency to explain what sort of\nthreat the assembled bishops can have seen in Timothy and his lone associate,\nand how Canon 3 might have responded to this.\n\n22. Baynes, “Alexandria and Constantinople,” 149 (= Byzantine Studies, 104); Errington, Roman\nImperial Policy, 219~20; “Church and State,” 38. The foundation for a partial rehabilitation of\nMaximus is sketched by Mossay, “Note sur Héron-Maxime.”\n\n23. Modern scholarship has too readily translated Gregory's claims that Peter “sent” the\nbishops who consecrated Maximus (DVS 851), and that they in turn “sent” sailors from the fleet\nahead as scouts (DVS 844~45), into a well-organized chain of command (McGuckin, Saint\nGregory, 314); but it should be noted that Ambrose of Milan, in subsequently making the case\nfor Maximus, seems to say only that Peter’s “mandate” extended to performing the cerernony\ninside a private house (Ep. extra Coll. 9[13|.3, ed. Zelzer, p. 202, where the word order given in\nthe apparatus is to be preferred to that of the text), and also that he carefully separates this\nmandate from the letters of communion which Peter gave Maximus, presumably during the\nlatter’s visit to Alexandria after his unsuccessful visit to the imperial court at Thessalonica (cf.\nDYS 1013-23).\n\n24.
